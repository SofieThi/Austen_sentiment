"65",141,"About thirty years ago Miss Maria Ward, of Huntingdon, with only seven",65
"66",141,"thousand pounds, had the good luck to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram, of",66
"67",141,"Mansfield Park, in the county of Northampton, and to be thereby raised",67
"68",141,"to the rank of a baronet’s lady, with all the comforts and consequences",68
"69",141,"of an handsome house and large income. All Huntingdon exclaimed on the",69
"70",141,"greatness of the match, and her uncle, the lawyer, himself, allowed her",70
"71",141,"to be at least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to",71
"72",141,"it. She had two sisters to be benefited by her elevation; and such of",72
"73",141,"their acquaintance as thought Miss Ward and Miss Frances quite as",73
"74",141,"handsome as Miss Maria, did not scruple to predict their marrying with",74
"75",141,"almost equal advantage. But there certainly are not so many men of",75
"76",141,"large fortune in the world as there are pretty women to deserve them.",76
"77",141,"Miss Ward, at the end of half a dozen years, found herself obliged to",77
"78",141,"be attached to the Rev. Mr. Norris, a friend of her brother-in-law,",78
"79",141,"with scarcely any private fortune, and Miss Frances fared yet worse.",79
"80",141,"Miss Ward’s match, indeed, when it came to the point, was not",80
"81",141,"contemptible: Sir Thomas being happily able to give his friend an",81
"82",141,"income in the living of Mansfield; and Mr. and Mrs. Norris began their",82
"83",141,"career of conjugal felicity with very little less than a thousand a",83
"84",141,"year. But Miss Frances married, in the common phrase, to disoblige her",84
"85",141,"family, and by fixing on a lieutenant of marines, without education,",85
"86",141,"fortune, or connexions, did it very thoroughly. She could hardly have",86
"87",141,"made a more untoward choice. Sir Thomas Bertram had interest, which,",87
"88",141,"from principle as well as pride—from a general wish of doing right, and",88
"89",141,"a desire of seeing all that were connected with him in situations of",89
"90",141,"respectability, he would have been glad to exert for the advantage of",90
"91",141,"Lady Bertram’s sister; but her husband’s profession was such as no",91
"92",141,"interest could reach; and before he had time to devise any other method",92
"93",141,"of assisting them, an absolute breach between the sisters had taken",93
"94",141,"place. It was the natural result of the conduct of each party, and such",94
"95",141,"as a very imprudent marriage almost always produces. To save herself",95
"96",141,"from useless remonstrance, Mrs. Price never wrote to her family on the",96
"97",141,"subject till actually married. Lady Bertram, who was a woman of very",97
"98",141,"tranquil feelings, and a temper remarkably easy and indolent, would",98
"99",141,"have contented herself with merely giving up her sister, and thinking",99
"100",141,"no more of the matter; but Mrs. Norris had a spirit of activity, which",100
"101",141,"could not be satisfied till she had written a long and angry letter to",101
"102",141,"Fanny, to point out the folly of her conduct, and threaten her with all",102
"103",141,"its possible ill consequences. Mrs. Price, in her turn, was injured and",103
"104",141,"angry; and an answer, which comprehended each sister in its bitterness,",104
"105",141,"and bestowed such very disrespectful reflections on the pride of Sir",105
"106",141,"Thomas as Mrs. Norris could not possibly keep to herself, put an end to",106
"107",141,"all intercourse between them for a considerable period.",107
"108",141,"",108
"109",141,"Their homes were so distant, and the circles in which they moved so",109
"110",141,"distinct, as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of each",110
"111",141,"other’s existence during the eleven following years, or, at least, to",111
"112",141,"make it very wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have",112
"113",141,"it in her power to tell them, as she now and then did, in an angry",113
"114",141,"voice, that Fanny had got another child. By the end of eleven years,",114
"115",141,"however, Mrs. Price could no longer afford to cherish pride or",115
"116",141,"resentment, or to lose one connexion that might possibly assist her. A",116
"117",141,"large and still increasing family, an husband disabled for active",117
"118",141,"service, but not the less equal to company and good liquor, and a very",118
"119",141,"small income to supply their wants, made her eager to regain the",119
"120",141,"friends she had so carelessly sacrificed; and she addressed Lady",120
"121",141,"Bertram in a letter which spoke so much contrition and despondence,",121
"122",141,"such a superfluity of children, and such a want of almost everything",122
"123",141,"else, as could not but dispose them all to a reconciliation. She was",123
"124",141,"preparing for her ninth lying-in; and after bewailing the circumstance,",124
"125",141,"and imploring their countenance as sponsors to the expected child, she",125
"126",141,"could not conceal how important she felt they might be to the future",126
"127",141,"maintenance of the eight already in being. Her eldest was a boy of ten",127
"128",141,"years old, a fine spirited fellow, who longed to be out in the world;",128
"129",141,"but what could she do? Was there any chance of his being hereafter",129
"130",141,"useful to Sir Thomas in the concerns of his West Indian property? No",130
"131",141,"situation would be beneath him; or what did Sir Thomas think of",131
"132",141,"Woolwich? or how could a boy be sent out to the East?",132
"133",141,"",133
"134",141,"The letter was not unproductive. It re-established peace and kindness.",134
"135",141,"Sir Thomas sent friendly advice and professions, Lady Bertram",135
"136",141,"dispatched money and baby-linen, and Mrs. Norris wrote the letters.",136
"137",141,"",137
"138",141,"Such were its immediate effects, and within a twelvemonth a more",138
"139",141,"important advantage to Mrs. Price resulted from it. Mrs. Norris was",139
"140",141,"often observing to the others that she could not get her poor sister",140
"141",141,"and her family out of her head, and that, much as they had all done for",141
"142",141,"her, she seemed to be wanting to do more; and at length she could not",142
"143",141,"but own it to be her wish that poor Mrs. Price should be relieved from",143
"144",141,"the charge and expense of one child entirely out of her great number.",144
"145",141,"“What if they were among them to undertake the care of her eldest",145
"146",141,"daughter, a girl now nine years old, of an age to require more",146
"147",141,"attention than her poor mother could possibly give? The trouble and",147
"148",141,"expense of it to them would be nothing, compared with the benevolence",148
"149",141,"of the action.” Lady Bertram agreed with her instantly. “I think we",149
"150",141,"cannot do better,” said she; “let us send for the child.”",150
"151",141,"",151
"152",141,"Sir Thomas could not give so instantaneous and unqualified a consent.",152
"153",141,"He debated and hesitated;—it was a serious charge;—a girl so brought up",153
"154",141,"must be adequately provided for, or there would be cruelty instead of",154
"155",141,"kindness in taking her from her family. He thought of his own four",155
"156",141,"children, of his two sons, of cousins in love, etc.;—but no sooner had",156
"157",141,"he deliberately begun to state his objections, than Mrs. Norris",157
"158",141,"interrupted him with a reply to them all, whether stated or not.",158
"159",141,"",159
"160",141,"“My dear Sir Thomas, I perfectly comprehend you, and do justice to the",160
"161",141,"generosity and delicacy of your notions, which indeed are quite of a",161
"162",141,"piece with your general conduct; and I entirely agree with you in the",162
"163",141,"main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of",163
"164",141,"providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one’s own hands;",164
"165",141,"and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my",165
"166",141,"mite upon such an occasion. Having no children of my own, who should I",166
"167",141,"look to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow, but the",167
"168",141,"children of my sisters?—and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just—but you",168
"169",141,"know I am a woman of few words and professions. Do not let us be",169
"170",141,"frightened from a good deed by a trifle. Give a girl an education, and",170
"171",141,"introduce her properly into the world, and ten to one but she has the",171
"172",141,"means of settling well, without farther expense to anybody. A niece of",172
"173",141,"ours, Sir Thomas, I may say, or at least of _yours_, would not grow up",173
"174",141,"in this neighbourhood without many advantages. I don’t say she would be",174
"175",141,"so handsome as her cousins. I dare say she would not; but she would be",175
"176",141,"introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable",176
"177",141,"circumstances as, in all human probability, would get her a creditable",177
"178",141,"establishment. You are thinking of your sons—but do not you know that,",178
"179",141,"of all things upon earth, _that_ is the least likely to happen, brought",179
"180",141,"up as they would be, always together like brothers and sisters? It is",180
"181",141,"morally impossible. I never knew an instance of it. It is, in fact, the",181
"182",141,"only sure way of providing against the connexion. Suppose her a pretty",182
"183",141,"girl, and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence,",183
"184",141,"and I dare say there would be mischief. The very idea of her having",184
"185",141,"been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and",185
"186",141,"neglect, would be enough to make either of the dear, sweet-tempered",186
"187",141,"boys in love with her. But breed her up with them from this time, and",187
"188",141,"suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel, and she will never be",188
"189",141,"more to either than a sister.”",189
"190",141,"",190
"191",141,"“There is a great deal of truth in what you say,” replied Sir Thomas,",191
"192",141,"“and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a",192
"193",141,"plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each.",193
"194",141,"I only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in, and",194
"195",141,"that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price, and creditable to",195
"196",141,"ourselves, we must secure to the child, or consider ourselves engaged",196
"197",141,"to secure to her hereafter, as circumstances may arise, the provision",197
"198",141,"of a gentlewoman, if no such establishment should offer as you are so",198
"199",141,"sanguine in expecting.”",199
"200",141,"",200
"201",141,"“I thoroughly understand you,” cried Mrs. Norris, “you are everything",201
"202",141,"that is generous and considerate, and I am sure we shall never disagree",202
"203",141,"on this point. Whatever I can do, as you well know, I am always ready",203
"204",141,"enough to do for the good of those I love; and, though I could never",204
"205",141,"feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your",205
"206",141,"own dear children, nor consider her, in any respect, so much my own, I",206
"207",141,"should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her. Is not she a",207
"208",141,"sister’s child? and could I bear to see her want while I had a bit of",208
"209",141,"bread to give her? My dear Sir Thomas, with all my faults I have a warm",209
"210",141,"heart; and, poor as I am, would rather deny myself the necessaries of",210
"211",141,"life than do an ungenerous thing. So, if you are not against it, I will",211
"212",141,"write to my poor sister tomorrow, and make the proposal; and, as soon",212
"213",141,"as matters are settled, _I_ will engage to get the child to Mansfield;",213
"214",141,"_you_ shall have no trouble about it. My own trouble, you know, I never",214
"215",141,"regard. I will send Nanny to London on purpose, and she may have a bed",215
"216",141,"at her cousin the saddler’s, and the child be appointed to meet her",216
"217",141,"there. They may easily get her from Portsmouth to town by the coach,",217
"218",141,"under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going. I",218
"219",141,"dare say there is always some reputable tradesman’s wife or other going",219
"220",141,"up.”",220
"221",141,"",221
"222",141,"Except to the attack on Nanny’s cousin, Sir Thomas no longer made any",222
"223",141,"objection, and a more respectable, though less economical rendezvous",223
"224",141,"being accordingly substituted, everything was considered as settled,",224
"225",141,"and the pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed. The",225
"226",141,"division of gratifying sensations ought not, in strict justice, to have",226
"227",141,"been equal; for Sir Thomas was fully resolved to be the real and",227
"228",141,"consistent patron of the selected child, and Mrs. Norris had not the",228
"229",141,"least intention of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance. As",229
"230",141,"far as walking, talking, and contriving reached, she was thoroughly",230
"231",141,"benevolent, and nobody knew better how to dictate liberality to others;",231
"232",141,"but her love of money was equal to her love of directing, and she knew",232
"233",141,"quite as well how to save her own as to spend that of her friends.",233
"234",141,"Having married on a narrower income than she had been used to look",234
"235",141,"forward to, she had, from the first, fancied a very strict line of",235
"236",141,"economy necessary; and what was begun as a matter of prudence, soon",236
"237",141,"grew into a matter of choice, as an object of that needful solicitude",237
"238",141,"which there were no children to supply. Had there been a family to",238
"239",141,"provide for, Mrs. Norris might never have saved her money; but having",239
"240",141,"no care of that kind, there was nothing to impede her frugality, or",240
"241",141,"lessen the comfort of making a yearly addition to an income which they",241
"242",141,"had never lived up to. Under this infatuating principle, counteracted",242
"243",141,"by no real affection for her sister, it was impossible for her to aim",243
"244",141,"at more than the credit of projecting and arranging so expensive a",244
"245",141,"charity; though perhaps she might so little know herself as to walk",245
"246",141,"home to the Parsonage, after this conversation, in the happy belief of",246
"247",141,"being the most liberal-minded sister and aunt in the world.",247
"248",141,"",248
"249",141,"When the subject was brought forward again, her views were more fully",249
"250",141,"explained; and, in reply to Lady Bertram’s calm inquiry of “Where shall",250
"251",141,"the child come to first, sister, to you or to us?” Sir Thomas heard",251
"252",141,"with some surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs. Norris’s power",252
"253",141,"to take any share in the personal charge of her. He had been",253
"254",141,"considering her as a particularly welcome addition at the Parsonage, as",254
"255",141,"a desirable companion to an aunt who had no children of her own; but he",255
"256",141,"found himself wholly mistaken. Mrs. Norris was sorry to say that the",256
"257",141,"little girl’s staying with them, at least as things then were, was",257
"258",141,"quite out of the question. Poor Mr. Norris’s indifferent state of",258
"259",141,"health made it an impossibility: he could no more bear the noise of a",259
"260",141,"child than he could fly; if, indeed, he should ever get well of his",260
"261",141,"gouty complaints, it would be a different matter: she should then be",261
"262",141,"glad to take her turn, and think nothing of the inconvenience; but just",262
"263",141,"now, poor Mr. Norris took up every moment of her time, and the very",263
"264",141,"mention of such a thing she was sure would distract him.",264
"265",141,"",265
"266",141,"“Then she had better come to us,” said Lady Bertram, with the utmost",266
"267",141,"composure. After a short pause Sir Thomas added with dignity, “Yes, let",267
"268",141,"her home be in this house. We will endeavour to do our duty by her, and",268
"269",141,"she will, at least, have the advantage of companions of her own age,",269
"270",141,"and of a regular instructress.”",270
"271",141,"",271
"272",141,"“Very true,” cried Mrs. Norris, “which are both very important",272
"273",141,"considerations; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she",273
"274",141,"has three girls to teach, or only two—there can be no difference. I",274
"275",141,"only wish I could be more useful; but you see I do all in my power. I",275
"276",141,"am not one of those that spare their own trouble; and Nanny shall fetch",276
"277",141,"her, however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor",277
"278",141,"away for three days. I suppose, sister, you will put the child in the",278
"279",141,"little white attic, near the old nurseries. It will be much the best",279
"280",141,"place for her, so near Miss Lee, and not far from the girls, and close",280
"281",141,"by the housemaids, who could either of them help to dress her, you",281
"282",141,"know, and take care of her clothes, for I suppose you would not think",282
"283",141,"it fair to expect Ellis to wait on her as well as the others. Indeed, I",283
"284",141,"do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else.”",284
"285",141,"",285
"286",141,"Lady Bertram made no opposition.",286
"287",141,"",287
"288",141,"“I hope she will prove a well-disposed girl,” continued Mrs. Norris,",288
"289",141,"“and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends.”",289
"290",141,"",290
"291",141,"“Should her disposition be really bad,” said Sir Thomas, “we must not,",291
"292",141,"for our own children’s sake, continue her in the family; but there is",292
"293",141,"no reason to expect so great an evil. We shall probably see much to",293
"294",141,"wish altered in her, and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance,",294
"295",141,"some meanness of opinions, and very distressing vulgarity of manner;",295
"296",141,"but these are not incurable faults; nor, I trust, can they be dangerous",296
"297",141,"for her associates. Had my daughters been _younger_ than herself, I",297
"298",141,"should have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter",298
"299",141,"of very serious moment; but, as it is, I hope there can be nothing to",299
"300",141,"fear for _them_, and everything to hope for _her_, from the",300
"301",141,"association.”",301
"302",141,"",302
"303",141,"“That is exactly what I think,” cried Mrs. Norris, “and what I was",303

"349",141,"Fanny Price was at this time just ten years old, and though there might",349
"350",141,"not be much in her first appearance to captivate, there was, at least,",350
"351",141,"nothing to disgust her relations. She was small of her age, with no",351
"352",141,"glow of complexion, nor any other striking beauty; exceedingly timid",352
"353",141,"and shy, and shrinking from notice; but her air, though awkward, was",353
"354",141,"not vulgar, her voice was sweet, and when she spoke her countenance was",354
"355",141,"pretty. Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly; and Sir",355
"356",141,"Thomas, seeing how much she needed encouragement, tried to be all that",356
"357",141,"was conciliating: but he had to work against a most untoward gravity of",357
"358",141,"deportment; and Lady Bertram, without taking half so much trouble, or",358
"359",141,"speaking one word where he spoke ten, by the mere aid of a",359
"360",141,"good-humoured smile, became immediately the less awful character of the",360

"362",141,"",362
"363",141,"The young people were all at home, and sustained their share in the",363
"364",141,"introduction very well, with much good humour, and no embarrassment, at",364
"365",141,"least on the part of the sons, who, at seventeen and sixteen, and tall",365
"366",141,"of their age, had all the grandeur of men in the eyes of their little",366
"367",141,"cousin. The two girls were more at a loss from being younger and in",367
"368",141,"greater awe of their father, who addressed them on the occasion with",368
"369",141,"rather an injudicious particularity. But they were too much used to",369
"370",141,"company and praise to have anything like natural shyness; and their",370
"371",141,"confidence increasing from their cousin’s total want of it, they were",371
"372",141,"soon able to take a full survey of her face and her frock in easy",372
"373",141,"indifference.",373
"374",141,"",374
"375",141,"They were a remarkably fine family, the sons very well-looking, the",375
"376",141,"daughters decidedly handsome, and all of them well-grown and forward of",376
"377",141,"their age, which produced as striking a difference between the cousins",377
"378",141,"in person, as education had given to their address; and no one would",378
"379",141,"have supposed the girls so nearly of an age as they really were. There",379
"380",141,"were in fact but two years between the youngest and Fanny. Julia",380
"381",141,"Bertram was only twelve, and Maria but a year older. The little visitor",381
"382",141,"meanwhile was as unhappy as possible. Afraid of everybody, ashamed of",382
"383",141,"herself, and longing for the home she had left, she knew not how to",383
"384",141,"look up, and could scarcely speak to be heard, or without crying. Mrs.",384
"385",141,"Norris had been talking to her the whole way from Northampton of her",385
"386",141,"wonderful good fortune, and the extraordinary degree of gratitude and",386
"387",141,"good behaviour which it ought to produce, and her consciousness of",387
"388",141,"misery was therefore increased by the idea of its being a wicked thing",388
"389",141,"for her not to be happy. The fatigue, too, of so long a journey, became",389
"390",141,"soon no trifling evil. In vain were the well-meant condescensions of",390
"391",141,"Sir Thomas, and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris that",391
"392",141,"she would be a good girl; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make her",392
"393",141,"sit on the sofa with herself and pug, and vain was even the sight of a",393
"394",141,"gooseberry tart towards giving her comfort; she could scarcely swallow",394
"395",141,"two mouthfuls before tears interrupted her, and sleep seeming to be her",395
"396",141,"likeliest friend, she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed.",396
"397",141,"",397
"398",141,"“This is not a very promising beginning,” said Mrs. Norris, when Fanny",398
"399",141,"had left the room. “After all that I said to her as we came along, I",399
"400",141,"thought she would have behaved better; I told her how much might depend",400
"401",141,"upon her acquitting herself well at first. I wish there may not be a",401
"402",141,"little sulkiness of temper—her poor mother had a good deal; but we must",402
"403",141,"make allowances for such a child—and I do not know that her being sorry",403
"404",141,"to leave her home is really against her, for, with all its faults, it",404
"405",141,"_was_ her home, and she cannot as yet understand how much she has",405
"406",141,"changed for the better; but then there is moderation in all things.”",406
"407",141,"",407
"408",141,"It required a longer time, however, than Mrs. Norris was inclined to",408
"409",141,"allow, to reconcile Fanny to the novelty of Mansfield Park, and the",409
"410",141,"separation from everybody she had been used to. Her feelings were very",410
"411",141,"acute, and too little understood to be properly attended to. Nobody",411
"412",141,"meant to be unkind, but nobody put themselves out of their way to",412
"413",141,"secure her comfort.",413

"416",141,"afford leisure for getting acquainted with, and entertaining their",416
"417",141,"young cousin, produced little union. They could not but hold her cheap",417
"418",141,"on finding that she had but two sashes, and had never learned French;",418
"419",141,"and when they perceived her to be little struck with the duet they were",419
"420",141,"so good as to play, they could do no more than make her a generous",420

"425",141,"Fanny, whether near or from her cousins, whether in the schoolroom, the",425
"426",141,"drawing-room, or the shrubbery, was equally forlorn, finding something",426
"427",141,"to fear in every person and place. She was disheartened by Lady",427
"428",141,"Bertram’s silence, awed by Sir Thomas’s grave looks, and quite overcome",428
"429",141,"by Mrs. Norris’s admonitions. Her elder cousins mortified her by",429
"430",141,"reflections on her size, and abashed her by noticing her shyness: Miss",430
"431",141,"Lee wondered at her ignorance, and the maid-servants sneered at her",431
"432",141,"clothes; and when to these sorrows was added the idea of the brothers",432
"433",141,"and sisters among whom she had always been important as playfellow,",433
"434",141,"instructress, and nurse, the despondence that sunk her little heart was",434
"435",141,"severe.",435
"436",141,"",436
"437",141,"The grandeur of the house astonished, but could not console her. The",437
"438",141,"rooms were too large for her to move in with ease: whatever she touched",438
"439",141,"she expected to injure, and she crept about in constant terror of",439
"440",141,"something or other; often retreating towards her own chamber to cry;",440
"441",141,"and the little girl who was spoken of in the drawing-room when she left",441
"442",141,"it at night as seeming so desirably sensible of her peculiar good",442
"443",141,"fortune, ended every day’s sorrows by sobbing herself to sleep. A week",443

"448",141,"“My dear little cousin,” said he, with all the gentleness of an",448
"449",141,"excellent nature, “what can be the matter?” And sitting down by her, he",449
"450",141,"was at great pains to overcome her shame in being so surprised, and",450
"451",141,"persuade her to speak openly. Was she ill? or was anybody angry with",451
"452",141,"her? or had she quarrelled with Maria and Julia? or was she puzzled",452
"453",141,"about anything in her lesson that he could explain? Did she, in short,",453
"454",141,"want anything he could possibly get her, or do for her? For a long",454
"455",141,"while no answer could be obtained beyond a “no, no—not at all—no, thank",455
"456",141,"you”; but he still persevered; and no sooner had he begun to revert to",456
"457",141,"her own home, than her increased sobs explained to him where the",457
"458",141,"grievance lay. He tried to console her.",458

"468",141,"thoughts than the rest. It was William whom she talked of most, and",468
"469",141,"wanted most to see. William, the eldest, a year older than herself, her",469
"470",141,"constant companion and friend; her advocate with her mother (of whom he",470
"471",141,"was the darling) in every distress. “William did not like she should",471

"500",141,"paper, and ruled her lines with all the goodwill that her brother could",500
"501",141,"himself have felt, and probably with somewhat more exactness. He",501
"502",141,"continued with her the whole time of her writing, to assist her with",502
"503",141,"his penknife or his orthography, as either were wanted; and added to",503
"504",141,"these attentions, which she felt very much, a kindness to her brother",504

"507",141,"Fanny’s feelings on the occasion were such as she believed herself",507
"508",141,"incapable of expressing; but her countenance and a few artless words",508
"509",141,"fully conveyed all their gratitude and delight, and her cousin began to",509
"510",141,"find her an interesting object. He talked to her more, and, from all",510
"511",141,"that she said, was convinced of her having an affectionate heart, and a",511
"512",141,"strong desire of doing right; and he could perceive her to be farther",512
"513",141,"entitled to attention by great sensibility of her situation, and great",513
"514",141,"timidity. He had never knowingly given her pain, but he now felt that",514
"515",141,"she required more positive kindness; and with that view endeavoured, in",515
"516",141,"the first place, to lessen her fears of them all, and gave her",516
"517",141,"especially a great deal of good advice as to playing with Maria and",517
"518",141,"Julia, and being as merry as possible.",518
"519",141,"",519
"520",141,"From this day Fanny grew more comfortable. She felt that she had a",520
"521",141,"friend, and the kindness of her cousin Edmund gave her better spirits",521
"522",141,"with everybody else. The place became less strange, and the people less",522
"523",141,"formidable; and if there were some amongst them whom she could not",523
"524",141,"cease to fear, she began at least to know their ways, and to catch the",524
"525",141,"best manner of conforming to them. The little rusticities and",525
"526",141,"awkwardnesses which had at first made grievous inroads on the",526
"527",141,"tranquillity of all, and not least of herself, necessarily wore away,",527

"529",141,"did her aunt Norris’s voice make her start very much. To her cousins",529
"530",141,"she became occasionally an acceptable companion. Though unworthy, from",530
"531",141,"inferiority of age and strength, to be their constant associate, their",531
"532",141,"pleasures and schemes were sometimes of a nature to make a third very",532
"533",141,"useful, especially when that third was of an obliging, yielding temper;",533
"534",141,"and they could not but own, when their aunt inquired into her faults,",534

"536",141,"was good-natured enough.”",536
"537",141,"",537
"538",141,"Edmund was uniformly kind himself; and she had nothing worse to endure",538
"539",141,"on the part of Tom than that sort of merriment which a young man of",539
"540",141,"seventeen will always think fair with a child of ten. He was just",540
"541",141,"entering into life, full of spirits, and with all the liberal",541
"542",141,"dispositions of an eldest son, who feels born only for expense and",542
"543",141,"enjoyment. His kindness to his little cousin was consistent with his",543
"544",141,"situation and rights: he made her some very pretty presents, and",544
"545",141,"laughed at her.",545
"546",141,"",546
"547",141,"As her appearance and spirits improved, Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris",547
"548",141,"thought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan; and it was",548
"549",141,"pretty soon decided between them that, though far from clever, she",549
"550",141,"showed a tractable disposition, and seemed likely to give them little",550
"551",141,"trouble. A mean opinion of her abilities was not confined to _them_.",551
"552",141,"Fanny could read, work, and write, but she had been taught nothing",552

"555",141,"for the first two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh",555
"556",141,"report of it into the drawing-room. “Dear mama, only think, my cousin",556

"661",141,"to want her; but William determining, soon after her removal, to be a",661
"662",141,"sailor, was invited to spend a week with his sister in Northamptonshire",662
"663",141,"before he went to sea. Their eager affection in meeting, their",663
"664",141,"exquisite delight in being together, their hours of happy mirth, and",664
"665",141,"moments of serious conference, may be imagined; as well as the sanguine",665
"666",141,"views and spirits of the boy even to the last, and the misery of the",666
"667",141,"girl when he left her. Luckily the visit happened in the Christmas",667

"674",141,"of proving them. Without any display of doing more than the rest, or",674

"707",141,"",707
"708",141,"The living was hereafter for Edmund; and, had his uncle died a few",708
"709",141,"years sooner, it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till",709
"710",141,"he were old enough for orders. But Tom’s extravagance had, previous to",710
"711",141,"that event, been so great as to render a different disposal of the next",711
"712",141,"presentation necessary, and the younger brother must help to pay for",712
"713",141,"the pleasures of the elder. There was another family living actually",713
"714",141,"held for Edmund; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement",714
"715",141,"somewhat easier to Sir Thomas’s conscience, he could not but feel it to",715
"716",141,"be an act of injustice, and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest",716
"717",141,"son with the same conviction, in the hope of its producing a better",717

"722",141,"feelings as a brother on the occasion. You have robbed Edmund for ten,",722
"723",141,"twenty, thirty years, perhaps for life, of more than half the income",723
"724",141,"which ought to be his. It may hereafter be in my power, or in yours (I",724
"725",141,"hope it will), to procure him better preferment; but it must not be",725
"726",141,"forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his",726
"727",141,"natural claims on us, and that nothing can, in fact, be an equivalent",727

"739",141,"who came consequently to reside at Mansfield; and on proving to be a",739
"740",141,"hearty man of forty-five, seemed likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram’s",740

"753",141,"fair than heretofore, by some recent losses on his West India estate,",753
"754",141,"in addition to his eldest son’s extravagance, it became not undesirable",754
"755",141,"to himself to be relieved from the expense of her support, and the",755
"756",141,"obligation of her future provision. In the fullness of his belief that",756
"757",141,"such a thing must be, he mentioned its probability to his wife; and the",757
"758",141,"first time of the subject’s occurring to her again happening to be when",758
"759",141,"Fanny was present, she calmly observed to her, “So, Fanny, you are",759

"892",141,"which could rank as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield parish,",892
"893",141,"the White House being only just large enough to receive herself and her",893
"894",141,"servants, and allow a spare room for a friend, of which she made a very",894
"895",141,"particular point. The spare rooms at the Parsonage had never been",895
"896",141,"wanted, but the absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend was now",896
"897",141,"never forgotten. Not all her precautions, however, could save her from",897

"1005",141,"consumed in the house. “Nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than",1005

"1046",141,"absence was unhappily most welcome. They were relieved by it from all",1046
"1047",141,"restraint; and without aiming at one gratification that would probably",1047

"1052",141,"ungrateful, and she really grieved because she could not grieve. “Sir",1052
"1053",141,"Thomas, who had done so much for her and her brothers, and who was gone",1053
"1054",141,"perhaps never to return! that she should see him go without a tear! it",1054
"1055",141,"was a shameful insensibility.” He had said to her, moreover, on the",1055
"1056",141,"very last morning, that he hoped she might see William again in the",1056
"1057",141,"course of the ensuing winter, and had charged her to write and invite",1057
"1058",141,"him to Mansfield as soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be",1058
"1059",141,"known to be in England. “This was so thoughtful and kind!” and would he",1059

"1181",141,"without. He had three horses of his own, but not one that would carry a",1181

"1206",141,"turn all his thoughts towards England; and the very great uncertainty",1206
"1207",141,"in which everything was then involved determined him on sending home",1207
"1208",141,"his son, and waiting the final arrangement by himself. Tom arrived",1208
"1209",141,"safely, bringing an excellent account of his father’s health; but to",1209
"1210",141,"very little purpose, as far as Mrs. Norris was concerned. Sir Thomas’s",1210

"1214",141,"on, was so terribly haunted by these ideas, in the sad solitariness of",1214
"1215",141,"her cottage, as to be obliged to take daily refuge in the dining-room",1215
"1216",141,"of the Park. The return of winter engagements, however, was not without",1216
"1217",141,"its effect; and in the course of their progress, her mind became so",1217

"1241",141,"was not long before a good understanding took place between this lady",1241
"1242",141,"and herself. Mrs. Rushworth acknowledged herself very desirous that her",1242

"1294",141,"care of a brother of their father, of whom Mrs. Grant knew nothing, she",1294

"1310",141,"furniture, and made a choice collection of plants and poultry—was very",1310
"1311",141,"much in want of some variety at home. The arrival, therefore, of a",1311

"1334",141,"remarkably pretty; Henry, though not handsome, had air and countenance;",1334
"1335",141,"the manners of both were lively and pleasant, and Mrs. Grant",1335
"1336",141,"immediately gave them credit for everything else. She was delighted",1336
"1337",141,"with each, but Mary was her dearest object; and having never been able",1337
"1338",141,"to glory in beauty of her own, she thoroughly enjoyed the power of",1338
"1339",141,"being proud of her sister’s. She had not waited her arrival to look out",1339
"1340",141,"for a suitable match for her: she had fixed on Tom Bertram; the eldest",1340

"1552",141,"higher stamp, for he had easy manners, excellent spirits, a large",1552
"1553",141,"acquaintance, and a great deal to say; and the reversion of Mansfield",1553
"1554",141,"Park, and a baronetcy, did no harm to all this. Miss Crawford soon felt",1554
"1555",141,"that he and his situation might do. She looked about her with due",1555
"1556",141,"consideration, and found almost everything in his favour: a park, a",1556
"1557",141,"real park, five miles round, a spacious modern-built house, so well",1557
"1558",141,"placed and well screened as to deserve to be in any collection of",1558
"1559",141,"engravings of gentlemen’s seats in the kingdom, and wanting only to be",1559
"1560",141,"completely new furnished—pleasant sisters, a quiet mother, and an",1560
"1561",141,"agreeable man himself—with the advantage of being tied up from much",1561
"1562",141,"gaming at present by a promise to his father, and of being Sir Thomas",1562
"1563",141,"hereafter. It might do very well; she believed she should accept him;",1563

"1569",141,"goings on, expect him back again for many weeks, it would bring his",1569
"1570",141,"passion to an early proof. Much was said on his side to induce her to",1570
"1571",141,"attend the races, and schemes were made for a large party to them, with",1571

"1573",141,"",1573
"1574",141,"And Fanny, what was _she_ doing and thinking all this while? and what",1574
"1575",141,"was _her_ opinion of the newcomers? Few young ladies of eighteen could",1575
"1576",141,"be less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny. In a quiet way,",1576
"1577",141,"very little attended to, she paid her tribute of admiration to Miss",1577
"1578",141,"Crawford’s beauty; but as she still continued to think Mr. Crawford",1578
"1579",141,"very plain, in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved the",1579
"1580",141,"contrary, she never mentioned _him_. The notice, which she excited",1580
"1581",141,"herself, was to this effect. “I begin now to understand you all, except",1581
"1582",141,"Miss Price,” said Miss Crawford, as she was walking with the Mr.",1582
"1583",141,"Bertrams. “Pray, is she out, or is she not? I am puzzled. She dined at",1583
"1584",141,"the Parsonage, with the rest of you, which seemed like being _out_; and",1584
"1585",141,"yet she says so little, that I can hardly suppose she _is_.”",1585
"1586",141,"",1586
"1587",141,"Edmund, to whom this was chiefly addressed, replied, “I believe I know",1587
"1588",141,"what you mean, but I will not undertake to answer the question. My",1588
"1589",141,"cousin is grown up. She has the age and sense of a woman, but the outs",1589
"1590",141,"and not outs are beyond me.”",1590
"1591",141,"",1591
"1592",141,"“And yet, in general, nothing can be more easily ascertained. The",1592
"1593",141,"distinction is so broad. Manners as well as appearance are, generally",1593
"1594",141,"speaking, so totally different. Till now, I could not have supposed it",1594
"1595",141,"possible to be mistaken as to a girl’s being out or not. A girl not out",1595
"1596",141,"has always the same sort of dress: a close bonnet, for instance; looks",1596
"1597",141,"very demure, and never says a word. You may smile, but it is so, I",1597
"1598",141,"assure you; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far,",1598
"1599",141,"it is all very proper. Girls should be quiet and modest. The most",1599
"1600",141,"objectionable part is, that the alteration of manners on being",1600
"1601",141,"introduced into company is frequently too sudden. They sometimes pass",1601
"1602",141,"in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite—to",1602
"1603",141,"confidence! _That_ is the faulty part of the present system. One does",1603
"1604",141,"not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to",1604
"1605",141,"every thing—and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the",1605
"1606",141,"year before. Mr. Bertram, I dare say _you_ have sometimes met with such",1606
"1607",141,"changes.”",1607

"1624",141,"I sat there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson, with only her and",1624
"1625",141,"a little girl or two in the room, the governess being sick or run away,",1625
"1626",141,"and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business, and I",1626
"1627",141,"could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady—nothing like a",1627
"1628",141,"civil answer—she screwed up her mouth, and turned from me with such an",1628
"1629",141,"air! I did not see her again for a twelvemonth. She was then _out_. I",1629
"1630",141,"met her at Mrs. Holford’s, and did not recollect her. She came up to",1630
"1631",141,"me, claimed me as an acquaintance, stared me out of countenance; and",1631
"1632",141,"talked and laughed till I did not know which way to look. I felt that I",1632
"1633",141,"must be the jest of the room at the time, and Miss Crawford, it is",1633
"1634",141,"plain, has heard the story.”",1634

"1636",141,"“And a very pretty story it is, and with more truth in it, I dare say,",1636
"1637",141,"than does credit to Miss Anderson. It is too common a fault. Mothers",1637
"1638",141,"certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their",1638
"1639",141,"daughters. I do not know where the error lies. I do not pretend to set",1639

"1645",141,"“The error is plain enough,” said the less courteous Edmund; “such",1645

"1651",141,"“I do not know,” replied Miss Crawford hesitatingly. “Yes, I cannot",1651
"1652",141,"agree with you there. It is certainly the modestest part of the",1652
"1653",141,"business. It is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the",1653
"1654",141,"same airs and take the same liberties as if they were, which I have",1654
"1655",141,"seen done. That is worse than anything—quite disgusting!”",1655

"1657",141,"“Yes, _that_ is very inconvenient indeed,” said Mr. Bertram. “It leads",1657
"1658",141,"one astray; one does not know what to do. The close bonnet and demure",1658
"1659",141,"air you describe so well (and nothing was ever juster), tell one what",1659
"1660",141,"is expected; but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want",1660
"1661",141,"of them. I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend last",1661
"1662",141,"September, just after my return from the West Indies. My friend",1662
"1663",141,"Sneyd—you have heard me speak of Sneyd, Edmund—his father, and mother,",1663
"1664",141,"and sisters, were there, all new to me. When we reached Albion Place",1664
"1665",141,"they were out; we went after them, and found them on the pier: Mrs. and",1665
"1666",141,"the two Miss Sneyds, with others of their acquaintance. I made my bow",1666
"1667",141,"in form; and as Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded by men, attached myself to",1667
"1668",141,"one of her daughters, walked by her side all the way home, and made",1668
"1669",141,"myself as agreeable as I could; the young lady perfectly easy in her",1669
"1670",141,"manners, and as ready to talk as to listen. I had not a suspicion that",1670
"1671",141,"I could be doing anything wrong. They looked just the same: both",1671
"1672",141,"well-dressed, with veils and parasols like other girls; but I",1672
"1673",141,"afterwards found that I had been giving all my attention to the",1673
"1674",141,"youngest, who was not _out_, and had most excessively offended the",1674
"1675",141,"eldest. Miss Augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six",1675

"2098",141,"“Oh yes! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did. I was",2098

"2100",141,"and who, whatever his faults may be, is so very fond of her brother,",2100
"2101",141,"treating him, they say, quite like a son. I could not have believed",2101

"2108",141,"“Ungrateful is a strong word. I do not know that her uncle has any",2108
"2109",141,"claim to her _gratitude_; his wife certainly had; and it is the warmth",2109
"2110",141,"of her respect for her aunt’s memory which misleads her here. She is",2110
"2111",141,"awkwardly circumstanced. With such warm feelings and lively spirits it",2111
"2112",141,"must be difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford,",2112
"2113",141,"without throwing a shade on the Admiral. I do not pretend to know which",2113
"2114",141,"was most to blame in their disagreements, though the Admiral’s present",2114
"2115",141,"conduct might incline one to the side of his wife; but it is natural",2115
"2116",141,"and amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely. I do",2116
"2117",141,"not censure her _opinions_; but there certainly _is_ impropriety in",2117
"2118",141,"making them public.”",2118
"2119",141,"",2119
"2120",141,"“Do not you think,” said Fanny, after a little consideration, “that",2120
"2121",141,"this impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford, as her",2121
"2122",141,"niece has been entirely brought up by her? She cannot have given her",2122
"2123",141,"right notions of what was due to the Admiral.”",2123

"2125",141,"“That is a fair remark. Yes, we must suppose the faults of the niece to",2125

"2127",141,"disadvantages she has been under. But I think her present home must do",2127
"2128",141,"her good. Mrs. Grant’s manners are just what they ought to be. She",2128

"2131",141,"“Yes, except as to his writing her such short letters. She made me",2131

"2133",141,"of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything",2133
"2134",141,"worth reading to his sisters, when they are separated. I am sure",2134
"2135",141,"William would never have used _me_ so, under any circumstances. And",2135
"2136",141,"what right had she to suppose that _you_ would not write long letters",2136
"2137",141,"when you were absent?”",2137

"2139",141,"“The right of a lively mind, Fanny, seizing whatever may contribute to",2139
"2140",141,"its own amusement or that of others; perfectly allowable, when",2140
"2141",141,"untinctured by ill-humour or roughness; and there is not a shadow of",2141
"2142",141,"either in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford: nothing sharp, or",2142
"2143",141,"loud, or coarse. She is perfectly feminine, except in the instances we",2143
"2144",141,"have been speaking of. There she cannot be justified. I am glad you saw",2144
"2145",141,"it all as I did.”",2145
"2146",141,"",2146
"2147",141,"Having formed her mind and gained her affections, he had a good chance",2147
"2148",141,"of her thinking like him; though at this period, and on this subject,",2148
"2149",141,"there began now to be some danger of dissimilarity, for he was in a",2149
"2150",141,"line of admiration of Miss Crawford, which might lead him where Fanny",2150
"2151",141,"could not follow. Miss Crawford’s attractions did not lessen. The harp",2151
"2152",141,"arrived, and rather added to her beauty, wit, and good-humour; for she",2152
"2153",141,"played with the greatest obligingness, with an expression and taste",2153
"2154",141,"which were peculiarly becoming, and there was something clever to be",2154
"2155",141,"said at the close of every air. Edmund was at the Parsonage every day,",2155
"2156",141,"to be indulged with his favourite instrument: one morning secured an",2156
"2157",141,"invitation for the next; for the lady could not be unwilling to have a",2157
"2158",141,"listener, and every thing was soon in a fair train.",2158
"2159",141,"",2159
"2160",141,"A young woman, pretty, lively, with a harp as elegant as herself, and",2160
"2161",141,"both placed near a window, cut down to the ground, and opening on a",2161
"2162",141,"little lawn, surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer, was",2162
"2163",141,"enough to catch any man’s heart. The season, the scene, the air, were",2163
"2164",141,"all favourable to tenderness and sentiment. Mrs. Grant and her tambour",2164
"2165",141,"frame were not without their use: it was all in harmony; and as",2165
"2166",141,"everything will turn to account when love is once set going, even the",2166
"2167",141,"sandwich tray, and Dr. Grant doing the honours of it, were worth",2167
"2168",141,"looking at. Without studying the business, however, or knowing what he",2168
"2169",141,"was about, Edmund was beginning, at the end of a week of such",2169
"2170",141,"intercourse, to be a good deal in love; and to the credit of the lady",2170
"2171",141,"it may be added that, without his being a man of the world or an elder",2171
"2172",141,"brother, without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small",2172
"2173",141,"talk, he began to be agreeable to her. She felt it to be so, though she",2173
"2174",141,"had not foreseen, and could hardly understand it; for he was not",2174
"2175",141,"pleasant by any common rule: he talked no nonsense; he paid no",2175
"2176",141,"compliments; his opinions were unbending, his attentions tranquil and",2176
"2177",141,"simple. There was a charm, perhaps, in his sincerity, his steadiness,",2177
"2178",141,"his integrity, which Miss Crawford might be equal to feel, though not",2178
"2179",141,"equal to discuss with herself. She did not think very much about it,",2179
"2180",141,"however: he pleased her for the present; she liked to have him near",2180
"2181",141,"her; it was enough.",2181
"2182",141,"",2182
"2183",141,"Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning;",2183
"2184",141,"she would gladly have been there too, might she have gone in uninvited",2184
"2185",141,"and unnoticed, to hear the harp; neither could she wonder that, when",2185
"2186",141,"the evening stroll was over, and the two families parted again, he",2186
"2187",141,"should think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their",2187
"2188",141,"home, while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park; but she",2188
"2189",141,"thought it a very bad exchange; and if Edmund were not there to mix the",2189
"2190",141,"wine and water for her, would rather go without it than not. She was a",2190
"2191",141,"little surprised that he could spend so many hours with Miss Crawford,",2191
"2192",141,"and not see more of the sort of fault which he had already observed,",2192
"2193",141,"and of which _she_ was almost always reminded by a something of the",2193
"2194",141,"same nature whenever she was in her company; but so it was. Edmund was",2194
"2195",141,"fond of speaking to her of Miss Crawford, but he seemed to think it",2195
"2196",141,"enough that the Admiral had since been spared; and she scrupled to",2196
"2197",141,"point out her own remarks to him, lest it should appear like",2197
"2198",141,"ill-nature. The first actual pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her",2198
"2199",141,"was the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride, which the",2199
"2200",141,"former caught, soon after her being settled at Mansfield, from the",2200
"2201",141,"example of the young ladies at the Park, and which, when Edmund’s",2201
"2202",141,"acquaintance with her increased, led to his encouraging the wish, and",2202
"2203",141,"the offer of his own quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts,",2203
"2204",141,"as the best fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish. No",2204
"2205",141,"pain, no injury, however, was designed by him to his cousin in this",2205
"2206",141,"offer: _she_ was not to lose a day’s exercise by it. The mare was only",2206
"2207",141,"to be taken down to the Parsonage half an hour before her ride were to",2207
"2208",141,"begin; and Fanny, on its being first proposed, so far from feeling",2208
"2209",141,"slighted, was almost over-powered with gratitude that he should be",2209
"2210",141,"asking her leave for it.",2210
"2211",141,"",2211
"2212",141,"Miss Crawford made her first essay with great credit to herself, and no",2212
"2213",141,"inconvenience to Fanny. Edmund, who had taken down the mare and",2213
"2214",141,"presided at the whole, returned with it in excellent time, before",2214
"2215",141,"either Fanny or the steady old coachman, who always attended her when",2215
"2216",141,"she rode without her cousins, were ready to set forward. The second",2216
"2217",141,"day’s trial was not so guiltless. Miss Crawford’s enjoyment of riding",2217
"2218",141,"was such that she did not know how to leave off. Active and fearless,",2218
"2219",141,"and though rather small, strongly made, she seemed formed for a",2219
"2220",141,"horsewoman; and to the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise, something",2220
"2221",141,"was probably added in Edmund’s attendance and instructions, and",2221
"2222",141,"something more in the conviction of very much surpassing her sex in",2222
"2223",141,"general by her early progress, to make her unwilling to dismount. Fanny",2223
"2224",141,"was ready and waiting, and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her for",2224
"2225",141,"not being gone, and still no horse was announced, no Edmund appeared.",2225
"2226",141,"To avoid her aunt, and look for him, she went out.",2226
"2227",141,"",2227
"2228",141,"The houses, though scarcely half a mile apart, were not within sight of",2228
"2229",141,"each other; but, by walking fifty yards from the hall door, she could",2229
"2230",141,"look down the park, and command a view of the Parsonage and all its",2230
"2231",141,"demesnes, gently rising beyond the village road; and in Dr. Grant’s",2231
"2232",141,"meadow she immediately saw the group—Edmund and Miss Crawford both on",2232
"2233",141,"horse-back, riding side by side, Dr. and Mrs. Grant, and Mr. Crawford,",2233
"2234",141,"with two or three grooms, standing about and looking on. A happy party",2234
"2235",141,"it appeared to her, all interested in one object: cheerful beyond a",2235
"2236",141,"doubt, for the sound of merriment ascended even to her. It was a sound",2236
"2237",141,"which did not make _her_ cheerful; she wondered that Edmund should",2237
"2238",141,"forget her, and felt a pang. She could not turn her eyes from the",2238
"2239",141,"meadow; she could not help watching all that passed. At first Miss",2239
"2240",141,"Crawford and her companion made the circuit of the field, which was not",2240
"2241",141,"small, at a foot’s pace; then, at _her_ apparent suggestion, they rose",2241
"2242",141,"into a canter; and to Fanny’s timid nature it was most astonishing to",2242
"2243",141,"see how well she sat. After a few minutes they stopped entirely. Edmund",2243
"2244",141,"was close to her; he was speaking to her; he was evidently directing",2244
"2245",141,"her management of the bridle; he had hold of her hand; she saw it, or",2245
"2246",141,"the imagination supplied what the eye could not reach. She must not",2246
"2247",141,"wonder at all this; what could be more natural than that Edmund should",2247
"2248",141,"be making himself useful, and proving his good-nature by any one? She",2248
"2249",141,"could not but think, indeed, that Mr. Crawford might as well have saved",2249
"2250",141,"him the trouble; that it would have been particularly proper and",2250
"2251",141,"becoming in a brother to have done it himself; but Mr. Crawford, with",2251
"2252",141,"all his boasted good-nature, and all his coachmanship, probably knew",2252
"2253",141,"nothing of the matter, and had no active kindness in comparison of",2253
"2254",141,"Edmund. She began to think it rather hard upon the mare to have such",2254
"2255",141,"double duty; if she were forgotten, the poor mare should be remembered.",2255
"2256",141,"",2256
"2257",141,"Her feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised by",2257
"2258",141,"seeing the party in the meadow disperse, and Miss Crawford still on",2258
"2259",141,"horseback, but attended by Edmund on foot, pass through a gate into the",2259
"2260",141,"lane, and so into the park, and make towards the spot where she stood.",2260
"2261",141,"She began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient; and walked",2261
"2262",141,"to meet them with a great anxiety to avoid the suspicion.",2262
"2263",141,"",2263
"2264",141,"“My dear Miss Price,” said Miss Crawford, as soon as she was at all",2264
"2265",141,"within hearing, “I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you",2265
"2266",141,"waiting; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself—I knew it",2266
"2267",141,"was very late, and that I was behaving extremely ill; and therefore, if",2267
"2268",141,"you please, you must forgive me. Selfishness must always be forgiven,",2268

"2270",141,"",2270
"2271",141,"Fanny’s answer was extremely civil, and Edmund added his conviction",2271
"2272",141,"that she could be in no hurry. “For there is more than time enough for",2272
"2273",141,"my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes,” said he, “and you",2273
"2274",141,"have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half",2274
"2275",141,"an hour sooner: clouds are now coming up, and she will not suffer from",2275
"2276",141,"the heat as she would have done then. I wish _you_ may not be fatigued",2276
"2277",141,"by so much exercise. I wish you had saved yourself this walk home.”",2277
"2278",141,"",2278
"2279",141,"“No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse, I assure you,”",2279
"2280",141,"said she, as she sprang down with his help; “I am very strong. Nothing",2280
"2281",141,"ever fatigues me but doing what I do not like. Miss Price, I give way",2281
"2282",141,"to you with a very bad grace; but I sincerely hope you will have a",2282
"2283",141,"pleasant ride, and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this",2283

"2286",141,"The old coachman, who had been waiting about with his own horse, now",2286
"2287",141,"joining them, Fanny was lifted on hers, and they set off across another",2287
"2288",141,"part of the park; her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing,",2288
"2289",141,"as she looked back, that the others were walking down the hill together",2289
"2290",141,"to the village; nor did her attendant do her much good by his comments",2290
"2291",141,"on Miss Crawford’s great cleverness as a horse-woman, which he had been",2291
"2292",141,"watching with an interest almost equal to her own.",2292

"2294",141,"“It is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart for riding!”",2294

"2301",141,"being gifted by Nature with strength and courage was fully appreciated",2301
"2302",141,"by the Miss Bertrams; her delight in riding was like their own; her",2302
"2303",141,"early excellence in it was like their own, and they had great pleasure",2303
"2304",141,"in praising it.",2304

"2309",141,"“Yes,” added Maria, “and her spirits are as good, and she has the same",2309

"2319",141,"next inclined to stay at home, I think Miss Crawford would be glad to",2319
"2320",141,"have her a longer time—for a whole morning, in short. She has a great",2320
"2321",141,"desire to get as far as Mansfield Common: Mrs. Grant has been telling",2321
"2322",141,"her of its fine views, and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal",2322
"2323",141,"to it. But any morning will do for this. She would be extremely sorry",2323
"2324",141,"to interfere with you. It would be very wrong if she did. _She_ rides",2324
"2325",141,"only for pleasure; _you_ for health.”",2325

"2331",141,"Edmund looked pleased, which must be Fanny’s comfort, and the ride to",2331
"2332",141,"Mansfield Common took place the next morning: the party included all",2332
"2333",141,"the young people but herself, and was much enjoyed at the time, and",2333
"2334",141,"doubly enjoyed again in the evening discussion. A successful scheme of",2334
"2335",141,"this sort generally brings on another; and the having been to Mansfield",2335
"2336",141,"Common disposed them all for going somewhere else the day after. There",2336
"2337",141,"were many other views to be shewn; and though the weather was hot,",2337
"2338",141,"there were shady lanes wherever they wanted to go. A young party is",2338
"2339",141,"always provided with a shady lane. Four fine mornings successively were",2339
"2340",141,"spent in this manner, in shewing the Crawfords the country, and doing",2340
"2341",141,"the honours of its finest spots. Everything answered; it was all gaiety",2341
"2342",141,"and good-humour, the heat only supplying inconvenience enough to be",2342
"2343",141,"talked of with pleasure—till the fourth day, when the happiness of one",2343
"2344",141,"of the party was exceedingly clouded. Miss Bertram was the one. Edmund",2344
"2345",141,"and Julia were invited to dine at the Parsonage, and _she_ was",2345
"2346",141,"excluded. It was meant and done by Mrs. Grant, with perfect",2346
"2347",141,"good-humour, on Mr. Rushworth’s account, who was partly expected at the",2347
"2348",141,"Park that day; but it was felt as a very grievous injury, and her good",2348
"2349",141,"manners were severely taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she",2349
"2350",141,"reached home. As Mr. Rushworth did _not_ come, the injury was",2350
"2351",141,"increased, and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over",2351
"2352",141,"him; she could only be sullen to her mother, aunt, and cousin, and",2352
"2353",141,"throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert.",2353
"2354",141,"",2354
"2355",141,"Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing-room,",2355
"2356",141,"fresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful, the very reverse of",2356
"2357",141,"what they found in the three ladies sitting there, for Maria would",2357
"2358",141,"scarcely raise her eyes from her book, and Lady Bertram was",2358
"2359",141,"half-asleep; and even Mrs. Norris, discomposed by her niece’s",2359
"2360",141,"ill-humour, and having asked one or two questions about the dinner,",2360
"2361",141,"which were not immediately attended to, seemed almost determined to say",2361
"2362",141,"no more. For a few minutes the brother and sister were too eager in",2362
"2363",141,"their praise of the night and their remarks on the stars, to think",2363
"2364",141,"beyond themselves; but when the first pause came, Edmund, looking",2364

"2370",141,"Her own gentle voice speaking from the other end of the room, which was",2370

"2377",141,"poor basket. There is all the new calico, that was bought last week,",2377

"2408",141,"cut the roses; and very pleasant it was, I assure you, but very hot. It",2408

"2510",141,"Fanny’s rides recommenced the very next day; and as it was a pleasant",2510
"2511",141,"fresh-feeling morning, less hot than the weather had lately been,",2511
"2512",141,"Edmund trusted that her losses, both of health and pleasure, would be",2512
"2513",141,"soon made good. While she was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived, escorting his",2513
"2514",141,"mother, who came to be civil and to shew her civility especially, in",2514
"2515",141,"urging the execution of the plan for visiting Sotherton, which had been",2515
"2516",141,"started a fortnight before, and which, in consequence of her subsequent",2516
"2517",141,"absence from home, had since lain dormant. Mrs. Norris and her nieces",2517
"2518",141,"were all well pleased with its revival, and an early day was named and",2518
"2519",141,"agreed to, provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged: the young ladies",2519
"2520",141,"did not forget that stipulation, and though Mrs. Norris would willingly",2520
"2521",141,"have answered for his being so, they would neither authorise the",2521
"2522",141,"liberty nor run the risk; and at last, on a hint from Miss Bertram, Mr.",2522
"2523",141,"Rushworth discovered that the properest thing to be done was for him to",2523
"2524",141,"walk down to the Parsonage directly, and call on Mr. Crawford, and",2524
"2525",141,"inquire whether Wednesday would suit him or not.",2525
"2526",141,"",2526
"2527",141,"Before his return Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford came in. Having been out",2527
"2528",141,"some time, and taken a different route to the house, they had not met",2528
"2529",141,"him. Comfortable hopes, however, were given that he would find Mr.",2529
"2530",141,"Crawford at home. The Sotherton scheme was mentioned of course. It was",2530
"2531",141,"hardly possible, indeed, that anything else should be talked of, for",2531
"2532",141,"Mrs. Norris was in high spirits about it; and Mrs. Rushworth, a",2532
"2533",141,"well-meaning, civil, prosing, pompous woman, who thought nothing of",2533
"2534",141,"consequence, but as it related to her own and her son’s concerns, had",2534
"2535",141,"not yet given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party. Lady",2535
"2536",141,"Bertram constantly declined it; but her placid manner of refusal made",2536
"2537",141,"Mrs. Rushworth still think she wished to come, till Mrs. Norris’s more",2537
"2538",141,"numerous words and louder tone convinced her of the truth.",2538
"2539",141,"",2539
"2540",141,"“The fatigue would be too much for my sister, a great deal too much, I",2540
"2541",141,"assure you, my dear Mrs. Rushworth. Ten miles there, and ten back, you",2541
"2542",141,"know. You must excuse my sister on this occasion, and accept of our two",2542
"2543",141,"dear girls and myself without her. Sotherton is the only place that",2543
"2544",141,"could give her a _wish_ to go so far, but it cannot be, indeed. She",2544
"2545",141,"will have a companion in Fanny Price, you know, so it will all do very",2545
"2546",141,"well; and as for Edmund, as he is not here to speak for himself, I will",2546
"2547",141,"answer for his being most happy to join the party. He can go on",2547
"2548",141,"horseback, you know.”",2548
"2549",141,"",2549
"2550",141,"Mrs. Rushworth being obliged to yield to Lady Bertram’s staying at",2550
"2551",141,"home, could only be sorry. “The loss of her ladyship’s company would be",2551
"2552",141,"a great drawback, and she should have been extremely happy to have seen",2552
"2553",141,"the young lady too, Miss Price, who had never been at Sotherton yet,",2553
"2554",141,"and it was a pity she should not see the place.”",2554
"2555",141,"",2555
"2556",141,"“You are very kind, you are all kindness, my dear madam,” cried Mrs.",2556
"2557",141,"Norris; “but as to Fanny, she will have opportunities in plenty of",2557
"2558",141,"seeing Sotherton. She has time enough before her; and her going now is",2558
"2559",141,"quite out of the question. Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her.”",2559
"2560",141,"",2560
"2561",141,"“Oh no! I cannot do without Fanny.”",2561
"2562",141,"",2562
"2563",141,"Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next, under the conviction that everybody must",2563
"2564",141,"be wanting to see Sotherton, to include Miss Crawford in the",2564
"2565",141,"invitation; and though Mrs. Grant, who had not been at the trouble of",2565
"2566",141,"visiting Mrs. Rushworth, on her coming into the neighbourhood, civilly",2566
"2567",141,"declined it on her own account, she was glad to secure any pleasure for",2567
"2568",141,"her sister; and Mary, properly pressed and persuaded, was not long in",2568
"2569",141,"accepting her share of the civility. Mr. Rushworth came back from the",2569
"2570",141,"Parsonage successful; and Edmund made his appearance just in time to",2570
"2571",141,"learn what had been settled for Wednesday, to attend Mrs. Rushworth to",2571
"2572",141,"her carriage, and walk half-way down the park with the two other",2572
"2573",141,"ladies.",2573
"2574",141,"",2574
"2575",141,"On his return to the breakfast-room, he found Mrs. Norris trying to",2575
"2576",141,"make up her mind as to whether Miss Crawford’s being of the party were",2576
"2577",141,"desirable or not, or whether her brother’s barouche would not be full",2577
"2578",141,"without her. The Miss Bertrams laughed at the idea, assuring her that",2578
"2579",141,"the barouche would hold four perfectly well, independent of the box, on",2579
"2580",141,"which _one_ might go with him.",2580
"2581",141,"",2581
"2582",141,"“But why is it necessary,” said Edmund, “that Crawford’s carriage, or",2582
"2583",141,"his _only_, should be employed? Why is no use to be made of my mother’s",2583
"2584",141,"chaise? I could not, when the scheme was first mentioned the other day,",2584
"2585",141,"understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the",2585
"2586",141,"carriage of the family.”",2586
"2587",141,"",2587
"2588",141,"“What!” cried Julia: “go boxed up three in a postchaise in this",2588
"2589",141,"weather, when we may have seats in a barouche! No, my dear Edmund, that",2589
"2590",141,"will not quite do.”",2590
"2591",141,"",2591
"2592",141,"“Besides,” said Maria, “I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking",2592
"2593",141,"us. After what passed at first, he would claim it as a promise.”",2593
"2594",141,"",2594
"2595",141,"“And, my dear Edmund,” added Mrs. Norris, “taking out _two_ carriages",2595
"2596",141,"when _one_ will do, would be trouble for nothing; and, between",2596
"2597",141,"ourselves, coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and",2597
"2598",141,"Sotherton: he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching",2598
"2599",141,"his carriage, and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas,",2599
"2600",141,"when he comes home, find all the varnish scratched off.”",2600
"2601",141,"",2601
"2602",141,"“That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford’s,”",2602
"2603",141,"said Maria; “but the truth is, that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow, and",2603
"2604",141,"does not know how to drive. I will answer for it that we shall find no",2604
"2605",141,"inconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday.”",2605
"2606",141,"",2606
"2607",141,"“There is no hardship, I suppose, nothing unpleasant,” said Edmund, “in",2607
"2608",141,"going on the barouche box.”",2608
"2609",141,"",2609
"2610",141,"“Unpleasant!” cried Maria: “oh dear! I believe it would be generally",2610
"2611",141,"thought the favourite seat. There can be no comparison as to one’s view",2611
"2612",141,"of the country. Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche-box",2612
"2613",141,"herself.”",2613
"2614",141,"",2614
"2615",141,"“There can be no objection, then, to Fanny’s going with you; there can",2615
"2616",141,"be no doubt of your having room for her.”",2616
"2617",141,"",2617
"2618",141,"“Fanny!” repeated Mrs. Norris; “my dear Edmund, there is no idea of her",2618
"2619",141,"going with us. She stays with her aunt. I told Mrs. Rushworth so. She",2619
"2620",141,"is not expected.”",2620
"2621",141,"",2621
"2622",141,"“You can have no reason, I imagine, madam,” said he, addressing his",2622
"2623",141,"mother, “for wishing Fanny _not_ to be of the party, but as it relates",2623
"2624",141,"to yourself, to your own comfort. If you could do without her, you",2624
"2625",141,"would not wish to keep her at home?”",2625
"2626",141,"",2626
"2627",141,"“To be sure not, but I _cannot_ do without her.”",2627
"2628",141,"",2628

"2630",141,"",2630
"2631",141,"There was a general cry out at this. “Yes,” he continued, “there is no",2631
"2632",141,"necessity for my going, and I mean to stay at home. Fanny has a great",2632
"2633",141,"desire to see Sotherton. I know she wishes it very much. She has not",2633
"2634",141,"often a gratification of the kind, and I am sure, ma’am, you would be",2634
"2635",141,"glad to give her the pleasure now?”",2635
"2636",141,"",2636
"2637",141,"“Oh yes! very glad, if your aunt sees no objection.”",2637
"2638",141,"",2638
"2639",141,"Mrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which could",2639
"2640",141,"remain—their having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth that Fanny could",2640
"2641",141,"not go, and the very strange appearance there would consequently be in",2641
"2642",141,"taking her, which seemed to her a difficulty quite impossible to be got",2642
"2643",141,"over. It must have the strangest appearance! It would be something so",2643
"2644",141,"very unceremonious, so bordering on disrespect for Mrs. Rushworth,",2644
"2645",141,"whose own manners were such a pattern of good-breeding and attention,",2645
"2646",141,"that she really did not feel equal to it. Mrs. Norris had no affection",2646
"2647",141,"for Fanny, and no wish of procuring her pleasure at any time; but her",2647
"2648",141,"opposition to Edmund _now_, arose more from partiality for her own",2648
"2649",141,"scheme, because it _was_ her own, than from anything else. She felt",2649
"2650",141,"that she had arranged everything extremely well, and that any",2650
"2651",141,"alteration must be for the worse. When Edmund, therefore, told her in",2651
"2652",141,"reply, as he did when she would give him the hearing, that she need not",2652
"2653",141,"distress herself on Mrs. Rushworth’s account, because he had taken the",2653
"2654",141,"opportunity, as he walked with her through the hall, of mentioning Miss",2654
"2655",141,"Price as one who would probably be of the party, and had directly",2655
"2656",141,"received a very sufficient invitation for his cousin, Mrs. Norris was",2656
"2657",141,"too much vexed to submit with a very good grace, and would only say,",2657
"2658",141,"“Very well, very well, just as you chuse, settle it your own way, I am",2658
"2659",141,"sure I do not care about it.”",2659
"2660",141,"",2660
"2661",141,"“It seems very odd,” said Maria, “that you should be staying at home",2661
"2662",141,"instead of Fanny.”",2662
"2663",141,"",2663
"2664",141,"“I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you,” added Julia,",2664
"2665",141,"hastily leaving the room as she spoke, from a consciousness that she",2665
"2666",141,"ought to offer to stay at home herself.",2666
"2667",141,"",2667
"2668",141,"“Fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires,” was",2668
"2669",141,"Edmund’s only reply, and the subject dropt.",2669
"2670",141,"",2670
"2671",141,"Fanny’s gratitude, when she heard the plan, was, in fact, much greater",2671
"2672",141,"than her pleasure. She felt Edmund’s kindness with all, and more than",2672
"2673",141,"all, the sensibility which he, unsuspicious of her fond attachment,",2673
"2674",141,"could be aware of; but that he should forego any enjoyment on her",2674
"2675",141,"account gave her pain, and her own satisfaction in seeing Sotherton",2675
"2676",141,"would be nothing without him.",2676
"2677",141,"",2677
"2678",141,"The next meeting of the two Mansfield families produced another",2678
"2679",141,"alteration in the plan, and one that was admitted with general",2679
"2680",141,"approbation. Mrs. Grant offered herself as companion for the day to",2680
"2681",141,"Lady Bertram in lieu of her son, and Dr. Grant was to join them at",2681
"2682",141,"dinner. Lady Bertram was very well pleased to have it so, and the young",2682
"2683",141,"ladies were in spirits again. Even Edmund was very thankful for an",2683
"2684",141,"arrangement which restored him to his share of the party; and Mrs.",2684
"2685",141,"Norris thought it an excellent plan, and had it at her tongue’s end,",2685
"2686",141,"and was on the point of proposing it, when Mrs. Grant spoke.",2686
"2687",141,"",2687
"2688",141,"Wednesday was fine, and soon after breakfast the barouche arrived, Mr.",2688
"2689",141,"Crawford driving his sisters; and as everybody was ready, there was",2689
"2690",141,"nothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to take",2690
"2691",141,"their places. The place of all places, the envied seat, the post of",2691
"2692",141,"honour, was unappropriated. To whose happy lot was it to fall? While",2692
"2693",141,"each of the Miss Bertrams were meditating how best, and with the most",2693
"2694",141,"appearance of obliging the others, to secure it, the matter was settled",2694
"2695",141,"by Mrs. Grant’s saying, as she stepped from the carriage, “As there are",2695
"2696",141,"five of you, it will be better that one should sit with Henry; and as",2696
"2697",141,"you were saying lately that you wished you could drive, Julia, I think",2697
"2698",141,"this will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson.”",2698
"2699",141,"",2699
"2700",141,"Happy Julia! Unhappy Maria! The former was on the barouche-box in a",2700
"2701",141,"moment, the latter took her seat within, in gloom and mortification;",2701
"2702",141,"and the carriage drove off amid the good wishes of the two remaining",2702
"2703",141,"ladies, and the barking of Pug in his mistress’s arms.",2703
"2704",141,"",2704
"2705",141,"Their road was through a pleasant country; and Fanny, whose rides had",2705
"2706",141,"never been extensive, was soon beyond her knowledge, and was very happy",2706
"2707",141,"in observing all that was new, and admiring all that was pretty. She",2707
"2708",141,"was not often invited to join in the conversation of the others, nor",2708
"2709",141,"did she desire it. Her own thoughts and reflections were habitually her",2709
"2710",141,"best companions; and, in observing the appearance of the country, the",2710
"2711",141,"bearings of the roads, the difference of soil, the state of the",2711
"2712",141,"harvest, the cottages, the cattle, the children, she found",2712
"2713",141,"entertainment that could only have been heightened by having Edmund to",2713
"2714",141,"speak to of what she felt. That was the only point of resemblance",2714
"2715",141,"between her and the lady who sat by her: in everything but a value for",2715
"2716",141,"Edmund, Miss Crawford was very unlike her. She had none of Fanny’s",2716
"2717",141,"delicacy of taste, of mind, of feeling; she saw Nature, inanimate",2717
"2718",141,"Nature, with little observation; her attention was all for men and",2718
"2719",141,"women, her talents for the light and lively. In looking back after",2719
"2720",141,"Edmund, however, when there was any stretch of road behind them, or",2720
"2721",141,"when he gained on them in ascending a considerable hill, they were",2721
"2722",141,"united, and a “there he is” broke at the same moment from them both,",2722
"2723",141,"more than once.",2723
"2724",141,"",2724
"2725",141,"For the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little real comfort:",2725
"2726",141,"her prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford and her sister sitting side",2726
"2727",141,"by side, full of conversation and merriment; and to see only his",2727
"2728",141,"expressive profile as he turned with a smile to Julia, or to catch the",2728
"2729",141,"laugh of the other, was a perpetual source of irritation, which her own",2729
"2730",141,"sense of propriety could but just smooth over. When Julia looked back,",2730
"2731",141,"it was with a countenance of delight, and whenever she spoke to them,",2731
"2732",141,"it was in the highest spirits: “her view of the country was charming,",2732
"2733",141,"she wished they could all see it,” etc.; but her only offer of exchange",2733
"2734",141,"was addressed to Miss Crawford, as they gained the summit of a long",2734
"2735",141,"hill, and was not more inviting than this: “Here is a fine burst of",2735
"2736",141,"country. I wish you had my seat, but I dare say you will not take it,",2736
"2737",141,"let me press you ever so much;” and Miss Crawford could hardly answer",2737
"2738",141,"before they were moving again at a good pace.",2738
"2739",141,"",2739
"2740",141,"When they came within the influence of Sotherton associations, it was",2740
"2741",141,"better for Miss Bertram, who might be said to have two strings to her",2741
"2742",141,"bow. She had Rushworth feelings, and Crawford feelings, and in the",2742
"2743",141,"vicinity of Sotherton the former had considerable effect. Mr.",2743
"2744",141,"Rushworth’s consequence was hers. She could not tell Miss Crawford that",2744
"2745",141,"“those woods belonged to Sotherton,” she could not carelessly observe",2745
"2746",141,"that “she believed that it was now all Mr. Rushworth’s property on each",2746
"2747",141,"side of the road,” without elation of heart; and it was a pleasure to",2747
"2748",141,"increase with their approach to the capital freehold mansion, and",2748
"2749",141,"ancient manorial residence of the family, with all its rights of",2749

"2752",141,"“Now we shall have no more rough road, Miss Crawford; our difficulties",2752

"2755",141,"Those cottages are really a disgrace. The church spire is reckoned",2755
"2756",141,"remarkably handsome. I am glad the church is not so close to the great",2756
"2757",141,"house as often happens in old places. The annoyance of the bells must",2757
"2758",141,"be terrible. There is the parsonage: a tidy-looking house, and I",2758
"2759",141,"understand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people. Those are",2759
"2760",141,"almshouses, built by some of the family. To the right is the steward’s",2760
"2761",141,"house; he is a very respectable man. Now we are coming to the",2761
"2762",141,"lodge-gates; but we have nearly a mile through the park still. It is",2762
"2763",141,"not ugly, you see, at this end; there is some fine timber, but the",2763
"2764",141,"situation of the house is dreadful. We go down hill to it for half a",2764
"2765",141,"mile, and it is a pity, for it would not be an ill-looking place if it",2765

"2774",141,"observing that “it was a sort of building which she could not look at",2774
"2775",141,"but with respect,” she added, “Now, where is the avenue? The house",2775
"2776",141,"fronts the east, I perceive. The avenue, therefore, must be at the back",2776
"2777",141,"of it. Mr. Rushworth talked of the west front.”",2777
"2778",141,"",2778
"2779",141,"“Yes, it is exactly behind the house; begins at a little distance, and",2779
"2780",141,"ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds. You may see",2780
"2781",141,"something of it here—something of the more distant trees. It is oak",2781
"2782",141,"entirely.”",2782
"2783",141,"",2783
"2784",141,"Miss Bertram could now speak with decided information of what she had",2784
"2785",141,"known nothing about when Mr. Rushworth had asked her opinion; and her",2785
"2786",141,"spirits were in as happy a flutter as vanity and pride could furnish,",2786
"2787",141,"when they drove up to the spacious stone steps before the principal",2787

"2794",141,"",2794
"2795",141,"",2795
"2796",141,"Mr. Rushworth was at the door to receive his fair lady; and the whole",2796
"2797",141,"party were welcomed by him with due attention. In the drawing-room they",2797
"2798",141,"were met with equal cordiality by the mother, and Miss Bertram had all",2798
"2799",141,"the distinction with each that she could wish. After the business of",2799
"2800",141,"arriving was over, it was first necessary to eat, and the doors were",2800
"2801",141,"thrown open to admit them through one or two intermediate rooms into",2801
"2802",141,"the appointed dining-parlour, where a collation was prepared with",2802
"2803",141,"abundance and elegance. Much was said, and much was ate, and all went",2803
"2804",141,"well. The particular object of the day was then considered. How would",2804
"2805",141,"Mr. Crawford like, in what manner would he chuse, to take a survey of",2805
"2806",141,"the grounds? Mr. Rushworth mentioned his curricle. Mr. Crawford",2806
"2807",141,"suggested the greater desirableness of some carriage which might convey",2807
"2808",141,"more than two. “To be depriving themselves of the advantage of other",2808
"2809",141,"eyes and other judgments, might be an evil even beyond the loss of",2809
"2810",141,"present pleasure.”",2810
"2811",141,"",2811
"2812",141,"Mrs. Rushworth proposed that the chaise should be taken also; but this",2812
"2813",141,"was scarcely received as an amendment: the young ladies neither smiled",2813
"2814",141,"nor spoke. Her next proposition, of shewing the house to such of them",2814
"2815",141,"as had not been there before, was more acceptable, for Miss Bertram was",2815
"2816",141,"pleased to have its size displayed, and all were glad to be doing",2816
"2817",141,"something.",2817
"2818",141,"",2818
"2819",141,"The whole party rose accordingly, and under Mrs. Rushworth’s guidance",2819
"2820",141,"were shewn through a number of rooms, all lofty, and many large, and",2820
"2821",141,"amply furnished in the taste of fifty years back, with shining floors,",2821
"2822",141,"solid mahogany, rich damask, marble, gilding, and carving, each",2822
"2823",141,"handsome in its way. Of pictures there were abundance, and some few",2823
"2824",141,"good, but the larger part were family portraits, no longer anything to",2824
"2825",141,"anybody but Mrs. Rushworth, who had been at great pains to learn all",2825
"2826",141,"that the housekeeper could teach, and was now almost equally well",2826
"2827",141,"qualified to shew the house. On the present occasion she addressed",2827
"2828",141,"herself chiefly to Miss Crawford and Fanny, but there was no comparison",2828
"2829",141,"in the willingness of their attention; for Miss Crawford, who had seen",2829
"2830",141,"scores of great houses, and cared for none of them, had only the",2830
"2831",141,"appearance of civilly listening, while Fanny, to whom everything was",2831
"2832",141,"almost as interesting as it was new, attended with unaffected",2832
"2833",141,"earnestness to all that Mrs. Rushworth could relate of the family in",2833
"2834",141,"former times, its rise and grandeur, regal visits and loyal efforts,",2834
"2835",141,"delighted to connect anything with history already known, or warm her",2835
"2836",141,"imagination with scenes of the past.",2836
"2837",141,"",2837
"2838",141,"The situation of the house excluded the possibility of much prospect",2838
"2839",141,"from any of the rooms; and while Fanny and some of the others were",2839
"2840",141,"attending Mrs. Rushworth, Henry Crawford was looking grave and shaking",2840
"2841",141,"his head at the windows. Every room on the west front looked across a",2841
"2842",141,"lawn to the beginning of the avenue immediately beyond tall iron",2842
"2843",141,"palisades and gates.",2843
"2844",141,"",2844
"2845",141,"Having visited many more rooms than could be supposed to be of any",2845
"2846",141,"other use than to contribute to the window-tax, and find employment for",2846
"2847",141,"housemaids, “Now,” said Mrs. Rushworth, “we are coming to the chapel,",2847
"2848",141,"which properly we ought to enter from above, and look down upon; but as",2848
"2849",141,"we are quite among friends, I will take you in this way, if you will",2849
"2850",141,"excuse me.”",2850
"2851",141,"",2851
"2852",141,"They entered. Fanny’s imagination had prepared her for something",2852
"2853",141,"grander than a mere spacious, oblong room, fitted up for the purpose of",2853
"2854",141,"devotion: with nothing more striking or more solemn than the profusion",2854
"2855",141,"of mahogany, and the crimson velvet cushions appearing over the ledge",2855
"2856",141,"of the family gallery above. “I am disappointed,” said she, in a low",2856
"2857",141,"voice, to Edmund. “This is not my idea of a chapel. There is nothing",2857
"2858",141,"awful here, nothing melancholy, nothing grand. Here are no aisles, no",2858
"2859",141,"arches, no inscriptions, no banners. No banners, cousin, to be ‘blown",2859
"2860",141,"by the night wind of heaven.’ No signs that a ‘Scottish monarch sleeps",2860
"2861",141,"below.’”",2861
"2862",141,"",2862
"2863",141,"“You forget, Fanny, how lately all this has been built, and for how",2863
"2864",141,"confined a purpose, compared with the old chapels of castles and",2864
"2865",141,"monasteries. It was only for the private use of the family. They have",2865
"2866",141,"been buried, I suppose, in the parish church. _There_ you must look for",2866
"2867",141,"the banners and the achievements.”",2867
"2868",141,"",2868
"2869",141,"“It was foolish of me not to think of all that; but I am disappointed.”",2869
"2870",141,"",2870
"2871",141,"Mrs. Rushworth began her relation. “This chapel was fitted up as you",2871
"2872",141,"see it, in James the Second’s time. Before that period, as I",2872
"2873",141,"understand, the pews were only wainscot; and there is some reason to",2873
"2874",141,"think that the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were",2874
"2875",141,"only purple cloth; but this is not quite certain. It is a handsome",2875
"2876",141,"chapel, and was formerly in constant use both morning and evening.",2876
"2877",141,"Prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain, within the",2877
"2878",141,"memory of many; but the late Mr. Rushworth left it off.”",2878
"2879",141,"",2879
"2880",141,"“Every generation has its improvements,” said Miss Crawford, with a",2880
"2881",141,"smile, to Edmund.",2881
"2882",141,"",2882
"2883",141,"Mrs. Rushworth was gone to repeat her lesson to Mr. Crawford; and",2883
"2884",141,"Edmund, Fanny, and Miss Crawford remained in a cluster together.",2884
"2885",141,"",2885
"2886",141,"“It is a pity,” cried Fanny, “that the custom should have been",2886
"2887",141,"discontinued. It was a valuable part of former times. There is",2887
"2888",141,"something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great",2888
"2889",141,"house, with one’s ideas of what such a household should be! A whole",2889
"2890",141,"family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine!”",2890
"2891",141,"",2891
"2892",141,"“Very fine indeed,” said Miss Crawford, laughing. “It must do the heads",2892
"2893",141,"of the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and",2893
"2894",141,"footmen to leave business and pleasure, and say their prayers here",2894
"2895",141,"twice a day, while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying",2895
"2896",141,"away.”",2896
"2897",141,"",2897
"2898",141,"“_That_ is hardly Fanny’s idea of a family assembling,” said Edmund.",2898
"2899",141,"“If the master and mistress do _not_ attend themselves, there must be",2899
"2900",141,"more harm than good in the custom.”",2900
"2901",141,"",2901
"2902",141,"“At any rate, it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such",2902
"2903",141,"subjects. Everybody likes to go their own way—to chuse their own time",2903
"2904",141,"and manner of devotion. The obligation of attendance, the formality,",2904
"2905",141,"the restraint, the length of time—altogether it is a formidable thing,",2905
"2906",141,"and what nobody likes; and if the good people who used to kneel and",2906
"2907",141,"gape in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come",2907
"2908",141,"when men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed, when they woke",2908
"2909",141,"with a headache, without danger of reprobation, because chapel was",2909
"2910",141,"missed, they would have jumped with joy and envy. Cannot you imagine",2910
"2911",141,"with what unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of",2911
"2912",141,"Rushworth did many a time repair to this chapel? The young Mrs.",2912
"2913",141,"Eleanors and Mrs. Bridgets—starched up into seeming piety, but with",2913
"2914",141,"heads full of something very different—especially if the poor chaplain",2914
"2915",141,"were not worth looking at—and, in those days, I fancy parsons were very",2915
"2916",141,"inferior even to what they are now.”",2916
"2917",141,"",2917
"2918",141,"For a few moments she was unanswered. Fanny coloured and looked at",2918
"2919",141,"Edmund, but felt too angry for speech; and he needed a little",2919
"2920",141,"recollection before he could say, “Your lively mind can hardly be",2920
"2921",141,"serious even on serious subjects. You have given us an amusing sketch,",2921
"2922",141,"and human nature cannot say it was not so. We must all feel _at_",2922
"2923",141,"_times_ the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish; but if",2923
"2924",141,"you are supposing it a frequent thing, that is to say, a weakness grown",2924
"2925",141,"into a habit from neglect, what could be expected from the _private_",2925
"2926",141,"devotions of such persons? Do you think the minds which are suffered,",2926
"2927",141,"which are indulged in wanderings in a chapel, would be more collected",2927
"2928",141,"in a closet?”",2928
"2929",141,"",2929
"2930",141,"“Yes, very likely. They would have two chances at least in their",2930
"2931",141,"favour. There would be less to distract the attention from without, and",2931
"2932",141,"it would not be tried so long.”",2932
"2933",141,"",2933
"2934",141,"“The mind which does not struggle against itself under _one_",2934
"2935",141,"circumstance, would find objects to distract it in the _other_, I",2935
"2936",141,"believe; and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse",2936
"2937",141,"better feelings than are begun with. The greater length of the service,",2937
"2938",141,"however, I admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind. One",2938
"2939",141,"wishes it were not so; but I have not yet left Oxford long enough to",2939
"2940",141,"forget what chapel prayers are.”",2940
"2941",141,"",2941
"2942",141,"While this was passing, the rest of the party being scattered about the",2942
"2943",141,"chapel, Julia called Mr. Crawford’s attention to her sister, by saying,",2943
"2944",141,"“Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria, standing side by side, exactly as",2944
"2945",141,"if the ceremony were going to be performed. Have not they completely",2945

"2947",141,"",2947
"2948",141,"Mr. Crawford smiled his acquiescence, and stepping forward to Maria,",2948
"2949",141,"said, in a voice which she only could hear, “I do not like to see Miss",2949
"2950",141,"Bertram so near the altar.”",2950
"2951",141,"",2951
"2952",141,"Starting, the lady instinctively moved a step or two, but recovering",2952
"2953",141,"herself in a moment, affected to laugh, and asked him, in a tone not",2953
"2954",141,"much louder, “If he would give her away?”",2954
"2955",141,"",2955
"2956",141,"“I am afraid I should do it very awkwardly,” was his reply, with a look",2956
"2957",141,"of meaning.",2957
"2958",141,"",2958
"2959",141,"Julia, joining them at the moment, carried on the joke.",2959

"2961",141,"“Upon my word, it is really a pity that it should not take place",2961
"2962",141,"directly, if we had but a proper licence, for here we are altogether,",2962
"2963",141,"and nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant.” And she",2963
"2964",141,"talked and laughed about it with so little caution as to catch the",2964
"2965",141,"comprehension of Mr. Rushworth and his mother, and expose her sister to",2965
"2966",141,"the whispered gallantries of her lover, while Mrs. Rushworth spoke with",2966

"2970",141,"“If Edmund were but in orders!” cried Julia, and running to where he",2970
"2971",141,"stood with Miss Crawford and Fanny: “My dear Edmund, if you were but in",2971
"2972",141,"orders now, you might perform the ceremony directly. How unlucky that",2972
"2973",141,"you are not ordained; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready.”",2973
"2974",141,"",2974
"2975",141,"Miss Crawford’s countenance, as Julia spoke, might have amused a",2975
"2976",141,"disinterested observer. She looked almost aghast under the new idea she",2976
"2977",141,"was receiving. Fanny pitied her. “How distressed she will be at what",2977
"2978",141,"she said just now,” passed across her mind.",2978
"2979",141,"",2979
"2980",141,"“Ordained!” said Miss Crawford; “what, are you to be a clergyman?”",2980

"2989",141,"The chapel was soon afterwards left to the silence and stillness which",2989
"2990",141,"reigned in it, with few interruptions, throughout the year. Miss",2990
"2991",141,"Bertram, displeased with her sister, led the way, and all seemed to",2991

"2994",141,"The lower part of the house had been now entirely shewn, and Mrs.",2994
"2995",141,"Rushworth, never weary in the cause, would have proceeded towards the",2995
"2996",141,"principal staircase, and taken them through all the rooms above, if her",2996
"2997",141,"son had not interposed with a doubt of there being time enough. “For",2997
"2998",141,"if,” said he, with the sort of self-evident proposition which many a",2998
"2999",141,"clearer head does not always avoid, “we are _too_ long going over the",2999
"3000",141,"house, we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors. It",3000

"3003",141,"Mrs. Rushworth submitted; and the question of surveying the grounds,",3003
"3004",141,"with the who and the how, was likely to be more fully agitated, and",3004
"3005",141,"Mrs. Norris was beginning to arrange by what junction of carriages and",3005
"3006",141,"horses most could be done, when the young people, meeting with an",3006

"3008",141,"immediately to turf and shrubs, and all the sweets of pleasure-grounds,",3008
"3009",141,"as by one impulse, one wish for air and liberty, all walked out.",3009
"3010",141,"",3010
"3011",141,"“Suppose we turn down here for the present,” said Mrs. Rushworth,",3011
"3012",141,"civilly taking the hint and following them. “Here are the greatest",3012
"3013",141,"number of our plants, and here are the curious pheasants.”",3013
"3014",141,"",3014
"3015",141,"“Query,” said Mr. Crawford, looking round him, “whether we may not find",3015

"3017",141,"promise. Mr. Rushworth, shall we summon a council on this lawn?”",3017
"3018",141,"",3018
"3019",141,"“James,” said Mrs. Rushworth to her son, “I believe the wilderness will",3019

"3021",141,"wilderness yet.”",3021
"3022",141,"",3022
"3023",141,"No objection was made, but for some time there seemed no inclination to",3023
"3024",141,"move in any plan, or to any distance. All were attracted at first by",3024
"3025",141,"the plants or the pheasants, and all dispersed about in happy",3025
"3026",141,"independence. Mr. Crawford was the first to move forward to examine the",3026
"3027",141,"capabilities of that end of the house. The lawn, bounded on each side",3027
"3028",141,"by a high wall, contained beyond the first planted area a",3028
"3029",141,"bowling-green, and beyond the bowling-green a long terrace walk, backed",3029
"3030",141,"by iron palisades, and commanding a view over them into the tops of the",3030
"3031",141,"trees of the wilderness immediately adjoining. It was a good spot for",3031
"3032",141,"fault-finding. Mr. Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr.",3032
"3033",141,"Rushworth; and when, after a little time, the others began to form into",3033
"3034",141,"parties, these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace by",3034
"3035",141,"Edmund, Miss Crawford, and Fanny, who seemed as naturally to unite, and",3035
"3036",141,"who, after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties,",3036
"3037",141,"left them and walked on. The remaining three, Mrs. Rushworth, Mrs.",3037
"3038",141,"Norris, and Julia, were still far behind; for Julia, whose happy star",3038
"3039",141,"no longer prevailed, was obliged to keep by the side of Mrs. Rushworth,",3039
"3040",141,"and restrain her impatient feet to that lady’s slow pace, while her",3040
"3041",141,"aunt, having fallen in with the housekeeper, who was come out to feed",3041
"3042",141,"the pheasants, was lingering behind in gossip with her. Poor Julia, the",3042
"3043",141,"only one out of the nine not tolerably satisfied with their lot, was",3043
"3044",141,"now in a state of complete penance, and as different from the Julia of",3044
"3045",141,"the barouche-box as could well be imagined. The politeness which she",3045
"3046",141,"had been brought up to practise as a duty made it impossible for her to",3046

"3420",141,"“Yes, yes, we saw him. He was posting away as if upon life and death,",3420

"3435",141,"absence, however, as she might have done. She felt that he had been",3435
"3436",141,"very ill-used, and was quite unhappy in having to communicate what had",3436
"3437",141,"passed. He joined her within five minutes after Julia’s exit; and",3437
"3438",141,"though she made the best of the story, he was evidently mortified and",3438
"3439",141,"displeased in no common degree. At first he scarcely said anything; his",3439
"3440",141,"looks only expressed his extreme surprise and vexation, and he walked",3440

"3442",141,"",3442
"3443",141,"“They desired me to stay—my cousin Maria charged me to say that you",3443

"3502",141,"turned up into another, when the voice and the laugh of Miss Crawford",3502
"3503",141,"once more caught her ear; the sound approached, and a few more windings",3503

"3505",141,"from the park, to which a sidegate, not fastened, had tempted them very",3505

"3508",141,"to reach at last, and had been sitting down under one of the trees.",3508
"3509",141,"This was their history. It was evident that they had been spending",3509
"3510",141,"their time pleasantly, and were not aware of the length of their",3510
"3511",141,"absence. Fanny’s best consolation was in being assured that Edmund had",3511
"3512",141,"wished for her very much, and that he should certainly have come back",3512
"3513",141,"for her, had she not been tired already; but this was not quite",3513

"3523",141,"wilderness, at the end of an hour and a half from their leaving the",3523
"3524",141,"house. Mrs. Norris had been too well employed to move faster. Whatever",3524
"3525",141,"cross-accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces,",3525
"3526",141,"she had found a morning of complete enjoyment; for the housekeeper,",3526
"3527",141,"after a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants, had taken",3527
"3528",141,"her to the dairy, told her all about their cows, and given her the",3528
"3529",141,"receipt for a famous cream cheese; and since Julia’s leaving them they",3529
"3530",141,"had been met by the gardener, with whom she had made a most",3530
"3531",141,"satisfactory acquaintance, for she had set him right as to his",3531
"3532",141,"grandson’s illness, convinced him that it was an ague, and promised him",3532
"3533",141,"a charm for it; and he, in return, had shewn her all his choicest",3533

"3537",141,"On this _rencontre_ they all returned to the house together, there to",3537

"3539",141,"Quarterly Reviews, till the return of the others, and the arrival of",3539
"3540",141,"dinner. It was late before the Miss Bertrams and the two gentlemen came",3540
"3541",141,"in, and their ramble did not appear to have been more than partially",3541
"3542",141,"agreeable, or at all productive of anything useful with regard to the",3542
"3543",141,"object of the day. By their own accounts they had been all walking",3543
"3544",141,"after each other, and the junction which had taken place at last",3544
"3545",141,"seemed, to Fanny’s observation, to have been as much too late for",3545
"3546",141,"re-establishing harmony, as it confessedly had been for determining on",3546
"3547",141,"any alteration. She felt, as she looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth,",3547
"3548",141,"that hers was not the only dissatisfied bosom amongst them: there was",3548
"3549",141,"gloom on the face of each. Mr. Crawford and Miss Bertram were much more",3549
"3550",141,"gay, and she thought that he was taking particular pains, during",3550
"3551",141,"dinner, to do away any little resentment of the other two, and restore",3551
"3552",141,"general good-humour.",3552
"3553",141,"",3553
"3554",141,"Dinner was soon followed by tea and coffee, a ten miles’ drive home",3554
"3555",141,"allowed no waste of hours; and from the time of their sitting down to",3555
"3556",141,"table, it was a quick succession of busy nothings till the carriage",3556
"3557",141,"came to the door, and Mrs. Norris, having fidgeted about, and obtained",3557
"3558",141,"a few pheasants’ eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper, and made",3558
"3559",141,"abundance of civil speeches to Mrs. Rushworth, was ready to lead the",3559
"3560",141,"way. At the same moment Mr. Crawford, approaching Julia, said, “I hope",3560
"3561",141,"I am not to lose my companion, unless she is afraid of the evening air",3561
"3562",141,"in so exposed a seat.” The request had not been foreseen, but was very",3562
"3563",141,"graciously received, and Julia’s day was likely to end almost as well",3563
"3564",141,"as it began. Miss Bertram had made up her mind to something different,",3564
"3565",141,"and was a little disappointed; but her conviction of being really the",3565
"3566",141,"one preferred comforted her under it, and enabled her to receive Mr.",3566
"3567",141,"Rushworth’s parting attentions as she ought. He was certainly better",3567
"3568",141,"pleased to hand her into the barouche than to assist her in ascending",3568
"3569",141,"the box, and his complacency seemed confirmed by the arrangement.",3569
"3570",141,"",3570
"3571",141,"“Well, Fanny, this has been a fine day for you, upon my word,” said",3571

"3636",141,"would unite her to the lover, on whom she had chosen that happiness",3636
"3637",141,"should depend. It was a gloomy prospect, and all she could do was to",3637
"3638",141,"throw a mist over it, and hope when the mist cleared away she should",3638

"3641",141,"_something_ which everybody who shuts their eyes while they look, or",3641
"3642",141,"their understandings while they reason, feels the comfort of. It would",3642

"4041",141,"feeling it would be a great honour to be asked by him, she thought it",4041
"4042",141,"must happen. He came towards their little circle; but instead of asking",4042
"4043",141,"her to dance, drew a chair near her, and gave her an account of the",4043
"4044",141,"present state of a sick horse, and the opinion of the groom, from whom",4044
"4045",141,"he had just parted. Fanny found that it was not to be, and in the",4045
"4046",141,"modesty of her nature immediately felt that she had been unreasonable",4046
"4047",141,"in expecting it. When he had told of his horse, he took a newspaper",4047
"4048",141,"from the table, and looking over it, said in a languid way, “If you",4048
"4049",141,"want to dance, Fanny, I will stand up with you.” With more than equal",4049
"4050",141,"civility the offer was declined; she did not wish to dance. “I am glad",4050
"4051",141,"of it,” said he, in a much brisker tone, and throwing down the",4051
"4052",141,"newspaper again, “for I am tired to death. I only wonder how the good",4052
"4053",141,"people can keep it up so long. They had need be _all_ in love, to find",4053

"4443",141,"difference, they wanted a piece containing very few characters in the",4443

"4445",141,"the best plays were run over in vain. Neither Hamlet, nor Macbeth, nor",4445

"4456",141,"perhaps, but for the low parts. If I _must_ give my opinion, I have",4456

"4486",141,"How came it never to be thought of before? It strikes me as if it would",4486
"4487",141,"do exactly. What say you all? Here are two capital tragic parts for",4487
"4488",141,"Yates and Crawford, and here is the rhyming Butler for me, if nobody",4488
"4489",141,"else wants it; a trifling part, but the sort of thing I should not",4489
"4490",141,"dislike, and, as I said before, I am determined to take anything and do",4490
"4491",141,"my best. And as for the rest, they may be filled up by anybody. It is",4491
"4492",141,"only Count Cassel and Anhalt.”",4492
"4493",141,"",4493
"4494",141,"The suggestion was generally welcome. Everybody was growing weary of",4494
"4495",141,"indecision, and the first idea with everybody was, that nothing had",4495
"4496",141,"been proposed before so likely to suit them all. Mr. Yates was",4496
"4497",141,"particularly pleased: he had been sighing and longing to do the Baron",4497
"4498",141,"at Ecclesford, had grudged every rant of Lord Ravenshaw’s, and been",4498
"4499",141,"forced to re-rant it all in his own room. The storm through Baron",4499
"4500",141,"Wildenheim was the height of his theatrical ambition; and with the",4500
"4501",141,"advantage of knowing half the scenes by heart already, he did now, with",4501
"4502",141,"the greatest alacrity, offer his services for the part. To do him",4502
"4503",141,"justice, however, he did not resolve to appropriate it; for remembering",4503
"4504",141,"that there was some very good ranting-ground in Frederick, he professed",4504
"4505",141,"an equal willingness for that. Henry Crawford was ready to take either.",4505
"4506",141,"Whichever Mr. Yates did not chuse would perfectly satisfy him, and a",4506
"4507",141,"short parley of compliment ensued. Miss Bertram, feeling all the",4507
"4508",141,"interest of an Agatha in the question, took on her to decide it, by",4508
"4509",141,"observing to Mr. Yates that this was a point in which height and figure",4509
"4510",141,"ought to be considered, and that _his_ being the tallest, seemed to fit",4510
"4511",141,"him peculiarly for the Baron. She was acknowledged to be quite right,",4511
"4512",141,"and the two parts being accepted accordingly, she was certain of the",4512
"4513",141,"proper Frederick. Three of the characters were now cast, besides Mr.",4513
"4514",141,"Rushworth, who was always answered for by Maria as willing to do",4514
"4515",141,"anything; when Julia, meaning, like her sister, to be Agatha, began to",4515

"4522",141,"Mr. Crawford desired _that_ might not be thought of: he was very sure",4522

"4525",141,"this was immediately opposed by Tom Bertram, who asserted the part of",4525

"4544",141,"Pleasantly, courteously, it was spoken; but the manner was lost in the",4544

"4546",141,"the injury to herself: it was a scheme, a trick; she was slighted,",4546
"4547",141,"Maria was preferred; the smile of triumph which Maria was trying to",4547
"4548",141,"suppress shewed how well it was understood; and before Julia could",4548

"4550",141,"her too, by saying, “Oh yes! Maria must be Agatha. Maria will be the",4550
"4551",141,"best Agatha. Though Julia fancies she prefers tragedy, I would not",4551
"4552",141,"trust her in it. There is nothing of tragedy about her. She has not the",4552
"4553",141,"look of it. Her features are not tragic features, and she walks too",4553
"4554",141,"quick, and speaks too quick, and would not keep her countenance. She",4554
"4555",141,"had better do the old countrywoman: the Cottager’s wife; you had,",4555
"4556",141,"indeed, Julia. Cottager’s wife is a very pretty part, I assure you. The",4556
"4557",141,"old lady relieves the high-flown benevolence of her husband with a good",4557

"4560",141,"“Cottager’s wife!” cried Mr. Yates. “What are you talking of? The most",4560

"4569",141,"acted there must be some guesswork; but I mean no disparagement to",4569
"4570",141,"Julia. We cannot have two Agathas, and we must have one Cottager’s",4570
"4571",141,"wife; and I am sure I set her the example of moderation myself in being",4571
"4572",141,"satisfied with the old Butler. If the part is trifling she will have",4572
"4573",141,"more credit in making something of it; and if she is so desperately",4573
"4574",141,"bent against everything humorous, let her take Cottager’s speeches",4574
"4575",141,"instead of Cottager’s wife’s, and so change the parts all through; _he_",4575

"4585",141,"character more difficult to be well represented than even Agatha. I",4585

"4587",141,"requires great powers, great nicety, to give her playfulness and",4587
"4588",141,"simplicity without extravagance. I have seen good actresses fail in the",4588
"4589",141,"part. Simplicity, indeed, is beyond the reach of almost every actress",4589
"4590",141,"by profession. It requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not.",4590
"4591",141,"It requires a gentlewoman—a Julia Bertram. You _will_ undertake it, I",4591
"4592",141,"hope?” turning to her with a look of anxious entreaty, which softened",4592
"4593",141,"her a little; but while she hesitated what to say, her brother again",4593

"4613",141,"was, perhaps, but at treacherous play with her. She looked suspiciously",4613
"4614",141,"at her sister; Maria’s countenance was to decide it: if she were vexed",4614

"4616",141,"well knew that on this ground Maria could not be happy but at her",4616
"4617",141,"expense. With hasty indignation, therefore, and a tremulous voice, she",4617

"4711",141,"unexceptionable, as Lovers’ Vows. The wonder is that it should not have",4711
"4712",141,"been thought of before. My stupidity was abominable, for here we have",4712

"4802",141,"was the loss of half a day’s work about those side-doors. The curtain",4802

"4809",141,"looking about me in the poultry-yard, and was just coming out, when who",4809
"4810",141,"should I see but Dick Jackson making up to the servants’ hall-door with",4810
"4811",141,"two bits of deal board in his hand, bringing them to father, you may be",4811
"4812",141,"sure; mother had chanced to send him of a message to father, and then",4812
"4813",141,"father had bid him bring up them two bits of board, for he could not no",4813
"4814",141,"how do without them. I knew what all this meant, for the servants’",4814
"4815",141,"dinner-bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads; and as I",4815
"4816",141,"hate such encroaching people (the Jacksons are very encroaching, I have",4816
"4817",141,"always said so: just the sort of people to get all they can), I said to",4817
"4818",141,"the boy directly (a great lubberly fellow of ten years old, you know,",4818
"4819",141,"who ought to be ashamed of himself), ‘_I’ll_ take the boards to your",4819
"4820",141,"father, Dick, so get you home again as fast as you can.’ The boy looked",4820
"4821",141,"very silly, and turned away without offering a word, for I believe I",4821
"4822",141,"might speak pretty sharp; and I dare say it will cure him of coming",4822

"4833",141,"would not have owned it. Maria, wanting Henry Crawford’s animating",4833

"5024",141,"supposing Fanny was now preparing for her _appearance_, as of course",5024
"5025",141,"she would come out when her cousin was married, Miss Crawford proceeded",5025
"5026",141,"to inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea, and said",5026
"5027",141,"that she had quite a curiosity to see him, and imagined him a very fine",5027

"5035",141,"with infinite regret, that he found it absolutely impossible for him to",5035
"5036",141,"undertake the part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler: he had been",5036
"5037",141,"most anxiously trying to make it out to be feasible, but it would not",5037
"5038",141,"do; he must give it up. “But there will not be the smallest difficulty",5038
"5039",141,"in filling it,” he added. “We have but to speak the word; we may pick",5039
"5040",141,"and chuse. I could name, at this moment, at least six young men within",5040
"5041",141,"six miles of us, who are wild to be admitted into our company, and",5041
"5042",141,"there are one or two that would not disgrace us: I should not be afraid",5042
"5043",141,"to trust either of the Olivers or Charles Maddox. Tom Oliver is a very",5043
"5044",141,"clever fellow, and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will",5044
"5045",141,"see anywhere, so I will take my horse early to-morrow morning and ride",5045

"5082",141,"spirits sinking under her aunt’s unkind reflection and reproach. To be",5082
"5083",141,"called into notice in such a manner, to hear that it was but the",5083
"5084",141,"prelude to something so infinitely worse, to be told that she must do",5084
"5085",141,"what was so impossible as to act; and then to have the charge of",5085
"5086",141,"obstinacy and ingratitude follow it, enforced with such a hint at the",5086
"5087",141,"dependence of her situation, had been too distressing at the time to",5087

"5089",141,"the superadded dread of what the morrow might produce in continuation",5089
"5090",141,"of the subject. Miss Crawford had protected her only for the time; and",5090
"5091",141,"if she were applied to again among themselves with all the",5091
"5092",141,"authoritative urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of, and Edmund",5092
"5093",141,"perhaps away, what should she do? She fell asleep before she could",5093
"5094",141,"answer the question, and found it quite as puzzling when she awoke the",5094
"5095",141,"next morning. The little white attic, which had continued her",5095
"5096",141,"sleeping-room ever since her first entering the family, proving",5096
"5097",141,"incompetent to suggest any reply, she had recourse, as soon as she was",5097
"5098",141,"dressed, to another apartment more spacious and more meet for walking",5098
"5099",141,"about in and thinking, and of which she had now for some time been",5099
"5100",141,"almost equally mistress. It had been their school-room; so called till",5100
"5101",141,"the Miss Bertrams would not allow it to be called so any longer, and",5101
"5102",141,"inhabited as such to a later period. There Miss Lee had lived, and",5102
"5103",141,"there they had read and written, and talked and laughed, till within",5103
"5104",141,"the last three years, when she had quitted them. The room had then",5104
"5105",141,"become useless, and for some time was quite deserted, except by Fanny,",5105
"5106",141,"when she visited her plants, or wanted one of the books, which she was",5106
"5107",141,"still glad to keep there, from the deficiency of space and",5107
"5108",141,"accommodation in her little chamber above: but gradually, as her value",5108
"5109",141,"for the comforts of it increased, she had added to her possessions, and",5109
"5110",141,"spent more of her time there; and having nothing to oppose her, had so",5110
"5111",141,"naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it, that it was now",5111
"5112",141,"generally admitted to be hers. The East room, as it had been called",5112
"5113",141,"ever since Maria Bertram was sixteen, was now considered Fanny’s,",5113
"5114",141,"almost as decidedly as the white attic: the smallness of the one making",5114
"5115",141,"the use of the other so evidently reasonable that the Miss Bertrams,",5115
"5116",141,"with every superiority in their own apartments which their own sense of",5116
"5117",141,"superiority could demand, were entirely approving it; and Mrs. Norris,",5117
"5118",141,"having stipulated for there never being a fire in it on Fanny’s",5118
"5119",141,"account, was tolerably resigned to her having the use of what nobody",5119
"5120",141,"else wanted, though the terms in which she sometimes spoke of the",5120
"5121",141,"indulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in the house.",5121
"5122",141,"",5122
"5123",141,"The aspect was so favourable that even without a fire it was habitable",5123
"5124",141,"in many an early spring and late autumn morning to such a willing mind",5124
"5125",141,"as Fanny’s; and while there was a gleam of sunshine she hoped not to be",5125
"5126",141,"driven from it entirely, even when winter came. The comfort of it in",5126
"5127",141,"her hours of leisure was extreme. She could go there after anything",5127
"5128",141,"unpleasant below, and find immediate consolation in some pursuit, or",5128
"5129",141,"some train of thought at hand. Her plants, her books—of which she had",5129
"5130",141,"been a collector from the first hour of her commanding a shilling—her",5130
"5131",141,"writing-desk, and her works of charity and ingenuity, were all within",5131
"5132",141,"her reach; or if indisposed for employment, if nothing but musing would",5132
"5133",141,"do, she could scarcely see an object in that room which had not an",5133
"5134",141,"interesting remembrance connected with it. Everything was a friend, or",5134

"5136",141,"of suffering to her; though her motives had often been misunderstood,",5136

"5138",141,"had known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule, and neglect, yet almost",5138
"5139",141,"every recurrence of either had led to something consolatory: her aunt",5139
"5140",141,"Bertram had spoken for her, or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, what",5140
"5141",141,"was yet more frequent or more dear, Edmund had been her champion and",5141
"5142",141,"her friend: he had supported her cause or explained her meaning, he had",5142
"5143",141,"told her not to cry, or had given her some proof of affection which",5143
"5144",141,"made her tears delightful; and the whole was now so blended together,",5144
"5145",141,"so harmonised by distance, that every former affliction had its charm.",5145
"5146",141,"The room was most dear to her, and she would not have changed its",5146

"5162",141,"she might inhale a breeze of mental strength herself. But she had more",5162

"5164",141,"undecided as to what she _ought_ _to_ _do_; and as she walked round the",5164
"5165",141,"room her doubts were increasing. Was she _right_ in refusing what was",5165
"5166",141,"so warmly asked, so strongly wished for—what might be so essential to a",5166
"5167",141,"scheme on which some of those to whom she owed the greatest",5167
"5168",141,"complaisance had set their hearts? Was it not ill-nature, selfishness,",5168
"5169",141,"and a fear of exposing herself? And would Edmund’s judgment, would his",5169
"5170",141,"persuasion of Sir Thomas’s disapprobation of the whole, be enough to",5170
"5171",141,"justify her in a determined denial in spite of all the rest? It would",5171
"5172",141,"be so horrible to her to act that she was inclined to suspect the truth",5172
"5173",141,"and purity of her own scruples; and as she looked around her, the",5173
"5174",141,"claims of her cousins to being obliged were strengthened by the sight",5174
"5175",141,"of present upon present that she had received from them. The table",5175
"5176",141,"between the windows was covered with work-boxes and netting-boxes which",5176
"5177",141,"had been given her at different times, principally by Tom; and she grew",5177
"5178",141,"bewildered as to the amount of the debt which all these kind",5178

"5180",141,"this attempt to find her way to her duty, and her gentle “Come in” was",5180
"5181",141,"answered by the appearance of one, before whom all her doubts were wont",5181

"5321",141,"It was, indeed, a triumphant day to Mr. Bertram and Maria. Such a",5321
"5322",141,"victory over Edmund’s discretion had been beyond their hopes, and was",5322
"5323",141,"most delightful. There was no longer anything to disturb them in their",5323
"5324",141,"darling project, and they congratulated each other in private on the",5324
"5325",141,"jealous weakness to which they attributed the change, with all the glee",5325
"5326",141,"of feelings gratified in every way. Edmund might still look grave, and",5326
"5327",141,"say he did not like the scheme in general, and must disapprove the play",5327
"5328",141,"in particular; their point was gained: he was to act, and he was driven",5328
"5329",141,"to it by the force of selfish inclinations only. Edmund had descended",5329
"5330",141,"from that moral elevation which he had maintained before, and they were",5330
"5331",141,"both as much the better as the happier for the descent.",5331
"5332",141,"",5332
"5333",141,"They behaved very well, however, to _him_ on the occasion, betraying no",5333
"5334",141,"exultation beyond the lines about the corners of the mouth, and seemed",5334
"5335",141,"to think it as great an escape to be quit of the intrusion of Charles",5335
"5336",141,"Maddox, as if they had been forced into admitting him against their",5336
"5337",141,"inclination. “To have it quite in their own family circle was what they",5337
"5338",141,"had particularly wished. A stranger among them would have been the",5338
"5339",141,"destruction of all their comfort”; and when Edmund, pursuing that idea,",5339
"5340",141,"gave a hint of his hope as to the limitation of the audience, they were",5340
"5341",141,"ready, in the complaisance of the moment, to promise anything. It was",5341
"5342",141,"all good-humour and encouragement. Mrs. Norris offered to contrive his",5342
"5343",141,"dress, Mr. Yates assured him that Anhalt’s last scene with the Baron",5343
"5344",141,"admitted a good deal of action and emphasis, and Mr. Rushworth",5344
"5345",141,"undertook to count his speeches.",5345
"5346",141,"",5346
"5347",141,"“Perhaps,” said Tom, “Fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now.",5347
"5348",141,"Perhaps you may persuade _her_.”",5348
"5349",141,"",5349
"5350",141,"“No, she is quite determined. She certainly will not act.”",5350
"5351",141,"",5351
"5352",141,"“Oh! very well.” And not another word was said; but Fanny felt herself",5352
"5353",141,"again in danger, and her indifference to the danger was beginning to",5353
"5354",141,"fail her already.",5354
"5355",141,"",5355
"5356",141,"There were not fewer smiles at the Parsonage than at the Park on this",5356
"5357",141,"change in Edmund; Miss Crawford looked very lovely in hers, and entered",5357
"5358",141,"with such an instantaneous renewal of cheerfulness into the whole",5358
"5359",141,"affair as could have but one effect on him. “He was certainly right in",5359
"5360",141,"respecting such feelings; he was glad he had determined on it.” And the",5360
"5361",141,"morning wore away in satisfactions very sweet, if not very sound. One",5361
"5362",141,"advantage resulted from it to Fanny: at the earnest request of Miss",5362
"5363",141,"Crawford, Mrs. Grant had, with her usual good-humour, agreed to",5363
"5364",141,"undertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted; and this was all",5364
"5365",141,"that occurred to gladden _her_ heart during the day; and even this,",5365
"5366",141,"when imparted by Edmund, brought a pang with it, for it was Miss",5366
"5367",141,"Crawford to whom she was obliged—it was Miss Crawford whose kind",5367
"5368",141,"exertions were to excite her gratitude, and whose merit in making them",5368
"5369",141,"was spoken of with a glow of admiration. She was safe; but peace and",5369
"5370",141,"safety were unconnected here. Her mind had been never farther from",5370
"5371",141,"peace. She could not feel that she had done wrong herself, but she was",5371
"5372",141,"disquieted in every other way. Her heart and her judgment were equally",5372
"5373",141,"against Edmund’s decision: she could not acquit his unsteadiness, and",5373
"5374",141,"his happiness under it made her wretched. She was full of jealousy and",5374
"5375",141,"agitation. Miss Crawford came with looks of gaiety which seemed an",5375
"5376",141,"insult, with friendly expressions towards herself which she could",5376
"5377",141,"hardly answer calmly. Everybody around her was gay and busy, prosperous",5377
"5378",141,"and important; each had their object of interest, their part, their",5378
"5379",141,"dress, their favourite scene, their friends and confederates: all were",5379
"5380",141,"finding employment in consultations and comparisons, or diversion in",5380
"5381",141,"the playful conceits they suggested. She alone was sad and",5381
"5382",141,"insignificant: she had no share in anything; she might go or stay; she",5382
"5383",141,"might be in the midst of their noise, or retreat from it to the",5383
"5384",141,"solitude of the East room, without being seen or missed. She could",5384
"5385",141,"almost think anything would have been preferable to this. Mrs. Grant",5385
"5386",141,"was of consequence: _her_ good-nature had honourable mention; her taste",5386
"5387",141,"and her time were considered; her presence was wanted; she was sought",5387
"5388",141,"for, and attended, and praised; and Fanny was at first in some danger",5388
"5389",141,"of envying her the character she had accepted. But reflection brought",5389
"5390",141,"better feelings, and shewed her that Mrs. Grant was entitled to",5390
"5391",141,"respect, which could never have belonged to _her_; and that, had she",5391
"5392",141,"received even the greatest, she could never have been easy in joining a",5392
"5393",141,"scheme which, considering only her uncle, she must condemn altogether.",5393
"5394",141,"",5394
"5395",141,"Fanny’s heart was not absolutely the only saddened one amongst them, as",5395

"5397",141,"though not quite so blamelessly.",5397
"5398",141,"",5398
"5399",141,"Henry Crawford had trifled with her feelings; but she had very long",5399
"5400",141,"allowed and even sought his attentions, with a jealousy of her sister",5400
"5401",141,"so reasonable as ought to have been their cure; and now that the",5401
"5402",141,"conviction of his preference for Maria had been forced on her, she",5402
"5403",141,"submitted to it without any alarm for Maria’s situation, or any",5403
"5404",141,"endeavour at rational tranquillity for herself. She either sat in",5404
"5405",141,"gloomy silence, wrapt in such gravity as nothing could subdue, no",5405

"5413",141,"few repulses; and becoming soon too busy with his play to have time for",5413
"5414",141,"more than one flirtation, he grew indifferent to the quarrel, or rather",5414
"5415",141,"thought it a lucky occurrence, as quietly putting an end to what might",5415

"5488",141,"terms was now become her greatest enemy: they were alienated from each",5488

"5491",141,"to Maria for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards Mr.",5491

"5493",141,"to prevent their being very good friends while their interests were the",5493
"5494",141,"same, the sisters, under such a trial as this, had not affection or",5494
"5495",141,"principle enough to make them merciful or just, to give them honour or",5495
"5496",141,"compassion. Maria felt her triumph, and pursued her purpose, careless",5496

"5525",141,"Everything was now in a regular train: theatre, actors, actresses, and",5525
"5526",141,"dresses, were all getting forward; but though no other great",5526
"5527",141,"impediments arose, Fanny found, before many days were past, that it was",5527
"5528",141,"not all uninterrupted enjoyment to the party themselves, and that she",5528
"5529",141,"had not to witness the continuance of such unanimity and delight as had",5529
"5530",141,"been almost too much for her at first. Everybody began to have their",5530
"5531",141,"vexation. Edmund had many. Entirely against _his_ judgment, a",5531
"5532",141,"scene-painter arrived from town, and was at work, much to the increase",5532
"5533",141,"of the expenses, and, what was worse, of the eclat of their",5533
"5534",141,"proceedings; and his brother, instead of being really guided by him as",5534
"5535",141,"to the privacy of the representation, was giving an invitation to every",5535
"5536",141,"family who came in his way. Tom himself began to fret over the",5536
"5537",141,"scene-painter’s slow progress, and to feel the miseries of waiting. He",5537
"5538",141,"had learned his part—all his parts, for he took every trifling one that",5538
"5539",141,"could be united with the Butler, and began to be impatient to be",5539
"5540",141,"acting; and every day thus unemployed was tending to increase his sense",5540
"5541",141,"of the insignificance of all his parts together, and make him more",5541
"5542",141,"ready to regret that some other play had not been chosen.",5542
"5543",141,"",5543
"5544",141,"Fanny, being always a very courteous listener, and often the only",5544
"5545",141,"listener at hand, came in for the complaints and the distresses of most",5545
"5546",141,"of them. _She_ knew that Mr. Yates was in general thought to rant",5546
"5547",141,"dreadfully; that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford; that Tom",5547
"5548",141,"Bertram spoke so quick he would be unintelligible; that Mrs. Grant",5548
"5549",141,"spoiled everything by laughing; that Edmund was behindhand with his",5549
"5550",141,"part, and that it was misery to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth,",5550
"5551",141,"who was wanting a prompter through every speech. She knew, also, that",5551
"5552",141,"poor Mr. Rushworth could seldom get anybody to rehearse with him: _his_",5552
"5553",141,"complaint came before her as well as the rest; and so decided to her",5553
"5554",141,"eye was her cousin Maria’s avoidance of him, and so needlessly often",5554
"5555",141,"the rehearsal of the first scene between her and Mr. Crawford, that she",5555
"5556",141,"had soon all the terror of other complaints from _him_. So far from",5556
"5557",141,"being all satisfied and all enjoying, she found everybody requiring",5557
"5558",141,"something they had not, and giving occasion of discontent to the",5558
"5559",141,"others. Everybody had a part either too long or too short; nobody would",5559
"5560",141,"attend as they ought; nobody would remember on which side they were to",5560
"5561",141,"come in; nobody but the complainer would observe any directions.",5561
"5562",141,"",5562
"5563",141,"Fanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from the",5563
"5564",141,"play as any of them; Henry Crawford acted well, and it was a pleasure",5564
"5565",141,"to _her_ to creep into the theatre, and attend the rehearsal of the",5565
"5566",141,"first act, in spite of the feelings it excited in some speeches for",5566
"5567",141,"Maria. Maria, she also thought, acted well, too well; and after the",5567
"5568",141,"first rehearsal or two, Fanny began to be their only audience; and",5568
"5569",141,"sometimes as prompter, sometimes as spectator, was often very useful.",5569
"5570",141,"As far as she could judge, Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor",5570
"5571",141,"of all: he had more confidence than Edmund, more judgment than Tom,",5571
"5572",141,"more talent and taste than Mr. Yates. She did not like him as a man,",5572
"5573",141,"but she must admit him to be the best actor, and on this point there",5573
"5574",141,"were not many who differed from her. Mr. Yates, indeed, exclaimed",5574
"5575",141,"against his tameness and insipidity; and the day came at last, when Mr.",5575
"5576",141,"Rushworth turned to her with a black look, and said, “Do you think",5576
"5577",141,"there is anything so very fine in all this? For the life and soul of",5577
"5578",141,"me, I cannot admire him; and, between ourselves, to see such an",5578
"5579",141,"undersized, little, mean-looking man, set up for a fine actor, is very",5579
"5580",141,"ridiculous in my opinion.”",5580
"5581",141,"",5581
"5582",141,"From this moment there was a return of his former jealousy, which",5582
"5583",141,"Maria, from increasing hopes of Crawford, was at little pains to",5583
"5584",141,"remove; and the chances of Mr. Rushworth’s ever attaining to the",5584
"5585",141,"knowledge of his two-and-forty speeches became much less. As to his",5585
"5586",141,"ever making anything _tolerable_ of them, nobody had the smallest idea",5586
"5587",141,"of that except his mother; _she_, indeed, regretted that his part was",5587
"5588",141,"not more considerable, and deferred coming over to Mansfield till they",5588
"5589",141,"were forward enough in their rehearsal to comprehend all his scenes;",5589
"5590",141,"but the others aspired at nothing beyond his remembering the catchword,",5590
"5591",141,"and the first line of his speech, and being able to follow the prompter",5591
"5592",141,"through the rest. Fanny, in her pity and kindheartedness, was at great",5592
"5593",141,"pains to teach him how to learn, giving him all the helps and",5593
"5594",141,"directions in her power, trying to make an artificial memory for him,",5594
"5595",141,"and learning every word of his part herself, but without his being much",5595
"5596",141,"the forwarder.",5596
"5597",141,"",5597
"5598",141,"Many uncomfortable, anxious, apprehensive feelings she certainly had;",5598
"5599",141,"but with all these, and other claims on her time and attention, she was",5599
"5600",141,"as far from finding herself without employment or utility amongst them,",5600
"5601",141,"as without a companion in uneasiness; quite as far from having no",5601
"5602",141,"demand on her leisure as on her compassion. The gloom of her first",5602
"5603",141,"anticipations was proved to have been unfounded. She was occasionally",5603
"5604",141,"useful to all; she was perhaps as much at peace as any.",5604
"5605",141,"",5605
"5606",141,"There was a great deal of needlework to be done, moreover, in which her",5606
"5607",141,"help was wanted; and that Mrs. Norris thought her quite as well off as",5607
"5608",141,"the rest, was evident by the manner in which she claimed it—“Come,",5608
"5609",141,"Fanny,” she cried, “these are fine times for you, but you must not be",5609
"5610",141,"always walking from one room to the other, and doing the lookings-on at",5610
"5611",141,"your ease, in this way; I want you here. I have been slaving myself",5611
"5612",141,"till I can hardly stand, to contrive Mr. Rushworth’s cloak without",5612
"5613",141,"sending for any more satin; and now I think you may give me your help",5613
"5614",141,"in putting it together. There are but three seams; you may do them in a",5614
"5615",141,"trice. It would be lucky for me if I had nothing but the executive part",5615
"5616",141,"to do. _You_ are best off, I can tell you: but if nobody did more than",5616
"5617",141,"_you_, we should not get on very fast.”",5617
"5618",141,"",5618
"5619",141,"Fanny took the work very quietly, without attempting any defence; but",5619
"5620",141,"her kinder aunt Bertram observed on her behalf—",5620
"5621",141,"",5621
"5622",141,"“One cannot wonder, sister, that Fanny _should_ be delighted: it is all",5622
"5623",141,"new to her, you know; you and I used to be very fond of a play",5623
"5624",141,"ourselves, and so am I still; and as soon as I am a little more at",5624
"5625",141,"leisure, _I_ mean to look in at their rehearsals too. What is the play",5625
"5626",141,"about, Fanny? you have never told me.”",5626
"5627",141,"",5627
"5628",141,"“Oh! sister, pray do not ask her now; for Fanny is not one of those who",5628

"5630",141,"",5630
"5631",141,"“I believe,” said Fanny to her aunt Bertram, “there will be three acts",5631
"5632",141,"rehearsed to-morrow evening, and that will give you an opportunity of",5632
"5633",141,"seeing all the actors at once.”",5633

"5635",141,"“You had better stay till the curtain is hung,” interposed Mrs. Norris;",5635

"5638",141,"draw up into very handsome festoons.”",5638
"5639",141,"",5639
"5640",141,"Lady Bertram seemed quite resigned to waiting. Fanny did not share her",5640
"5641",141,"aunt’s composure: she thought of the morrow a great deal, for if the",5641
"5642",141,"three acts were rehearsed, Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be",5642
"5643",141,"acting together for the first time; the third act would bring a scene",5643
"5644",141,"between them which interested her most particularly, and which she was",5644
"5645",141,"longing and dreading to see how they would perform. The whole subject",5645
"5646",141,"of it was love—a marriage of love was to be described by the gentleman,",5646
"5647",141,"and very little short of a declaration of love be made by the lady.",5647
"5648",141,"",5648
"5649",141,"She had read and read the scene again with many painful, many wondering",5649
"5650",141,"emotions, and looked forward to their representation of it as a",5650
"5651",141,"circumstance almost too interesting. She did not _believe_ they had yet",5651
"5652",141,"rehearsed it, even in private.",5652
"5653",141,"",5653
"5654",141,"The morrow came, the plan for the evening continued, and Fanny’s",5654
"5655",141,"consideration of it did not become less agitated. She worked very",5655
"5656",141,"diligently under her aunt’s directions, but her diligence and her",5656
"5657",141,"silence concealed a very absent, anxious mind; and about noon she made",5657
"5658",141,"her escape with her work to the East room, that she might have no",5658
"5659",141,"concern in another, and, as she deemed it, most unnecessary rehearsal",5659
"5660",141,"of the first act, which Henry Crawford was just proposing, desirous at",5660
"5661",141,"once of having her time to herself, and of avoiding the sight of Mr.",5661
"5662",141,"Rushworth. A glimpse, as she passed through the hall, of the two ladies",5662
"5663",141,"walking up from the Parsonage made no change in her wish of retreat,",5663
"5664",141,"and she worked and meditated in the East room, undisturbed, for a",5664

"5687",141,"“Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean?” continued Miss",5687

"5690",141,"_that_. How am I ever to look him in the face and say such things?",5690
"5691",141,"Could you do it? But then he is your cousin, which makes all the",5691
"5692",141,"difference. You must rehearse it with me, that I may fancy _you_ him,",5692

"5698",141,"“_None_ of it, I suppose. You are to have the book, of course. Now for",5698
"5699",141,"it. We must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the",5699
"5700",141,"front of the stage. There—very good school-room chairs, not made for a",5700
"5701",141,"theatre, I dare say; much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick",5701
"5702",141,"their feet against when they are learning a lesson. What would your",5702
"5703",141,"governess and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose? Could",5703
"5704",141,"Sir Thomas look in upon us just now, he would bless himself, for we are",5704
"5705",141,"rehearsing all over the house. Yates is storming away in the",5705

"5707",141,"of course by those indefatigable rehearsers, Agatha and Frederick. If",5707
"5708",141,"_they_ are not perfect, I _shall_ be surprised. By the bye, I looked in",5708
"5709",141,"upon them five minutes ago, and it happened to be exactly at one of the",5709
"5710",141,"times when they were trying _not_ to embrace, and Mr. Rushworth was",5710
"5711",141,"with me. I thought he began to look a little queer, so I turned it off",5711
"5712",141,"as well as I could, by whispering to him, ‘We shall have an excellent",5712

"5719",141,"with looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of",5719
"5720",141,"a man. With such an Anhalt, however, Miss Crawford had courage enough;",5720

"5729",141,"prepare for the evening, without knowing Miss Crawford to be in the",5729

"5732",141,"kind offices.",5732

"5734",141,"_She_ could not equal them in their warmth. _Her_ spirits sank under",5734
"5735",141,"the glow of theirs, and she felt herself becoming too nearly nothing to",5735
"5736",141,"both to have any comfort in having been sought by either. They must now",5736
"5737",141,"rehearse together. Edmund proposed, urged, entreated it, till the lady,",5737
"5738",141,"not very unwilling at first, could refuse no longer, and Fanny was",5738
"5739",141,"wanted only to prompt and observe them. She was invested, indeed, with",5739
"5740",141,"the office of judge and critic, and earnestly desired to exercise it",5740
"5741",141,"and tell them all their faults; but from doing so every feeling within",5741
"5742",141,"her shrank—she could not, would not, dared not attempt it: had she been",5742
"5743",141,"otherwise qualified for criticism, her conscience must have restrained",5743
"5744",141,"her from venturing at disapprobation. She believed herself to feel too",5744
"5745",141,"much of it in the aggregate for honesty or safety in particulars. To",5745
"5746",141,"prompt them must be enough for her; and it was sometimes _more_ than",5746
"5747",141,"enough; for she could not always pay attention to the book. In watching",5747
"5748",141,"them she forgot herself; and, agitated by the increasing spirit of",5748
"5749",141,"Edmund’s manner, had once closed the page and turned away exactly as he",5749
"5750",141,"wanted help. It was imputed to very reasonable weariness, and she was",5750
"5751",141,"thanked and pitied; but she deserved their pity more than she hoped",5751
"5752",141,"they would ever surmise. At last the scene was over, and Fanny forced",5752
"5753",141,"herself to add her praise to the compliments each was giving the other;",5753

"5761",141,"take place in the evening: Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords were engaged to",5761
"5762",141,"return for that purpose as soon as they could after dinner; and every",5762
"5763",141,"one concerned was looking forward with eagerness. There seemed a",5763
"5764",141,"general diffusion of cheerfulness on the occasion. Tom was enjoying",5764
"5765",141,"such an advance towards the end; Edmund was in spirits from the",5765
"5766",141,"morning’s rehearsal, and little vexations seemed everywhere smoothed",5766
"5767",141,"away. All were alert and impatient; the ladies moved soon, the",5767
"5768",141,"gentlemen soon followed them, and with the exception of Lady Bertram,",5768
"5769",141,"Mrs. Norris, and Julia, everybody was in the theatre at an early hour;",5769
"5770",141,"and having lighted it up as well as its unfinished state admitted, were",5770

"5773",141,"They did not wait long for the Crawfords, but there was no Mrs. Grant.",5773
"5774",141,"She could not come. Dr. Grant, professing an indisposition, for which",5774

"5778",141,"“Dr. Grant is ill,” said she, with mock solemnity. “He has been ill",5778
"5779",141,"ever since he did not eat any of the pheasant today. He fancied it",5779
"5780",141,"tough, sent away his plate, and has been suffering ever since”.",5780
"5781",141,"",5781
"5782",141,"Here was disappointment! Mrs. Grant’s non-attendance was sad indeed.",5782

"5785",141,"act, they could not rehearse with any satisfaction without her. The",5785
"5786",141,"comfort of the whole evening was destroyed. What was to be done? Tom,",5786
"5787",141,"as Cottager, was in despair. After a pause of perplexity, some eyes",5787
"5788",141,"began to be turned towards Fanny, and a voice or two to say, “If Miss",5788
"5789",141,"Price would be so good as to _read_ the part.” She was immediately",5789
"5790",141,"surrounded by supplications; everybody asked it; even Edmund said, “Do,",5790

"5792",141,"",5792
"5793",141,"But Fanny still hung back. She could not endure the idea of it. Why was",5793
"5794",141,"not Miss Crawford to be applied to as well? Or why had not she rather",5794
"5795",141,"gone to her own room, as she had felt to be safest, instead of",5795
"5796",141,"attending the rehearsal at all? She had known it would irritate and",5796

"5827",141,"felt the instantaneous conviction. Not a hope of imposition or mistake",5827
"5828",141,"was harboured anywhere. Julia’s looks were an evidence of the fact that",5828
"5829",141,"made it indisputable; and after the first starts and exclamations, not",5829
"5830",141,"a word was spoken for half a minute: each with an altered countenance",5830
"5831",141,"was looking at some other, and almost each was feeling it a stroke the",5831
"5832",141,"most unwelcome, most ill-timed, most appalling! Mr. Yates might",5832
"5833",141,"consider it only as a vexatious interruption for the evening, and Mr.",5833
"5834",141,"Rushworth might imagine it a blessing; but every other heart was",5834
"5835",141,"sinking under some degree of self-condemnation or undefined alarm,",5835
"5836",141,"every other heart was suggesting, “What will become of us? what is to",5836
"5837",141,"be done now?” It was a terrible pause; and terrible to every ear were",5837
"5838",141,"the corroborating sounds of opening doors and passing footsteps.",5838
"5839",141,"",5839
"5840",141,"Julia was the first to move and speak again. Jealousy and bitterness",5840
"5841",141,"had been suspended: selfishness was lost in the common cause; but at",5841
"5842",141,"the moment of her appearance, Frederick was listening with looks of",5842
"5843",141,"devotion to Agatha’s narrative, and pressing her hand to his heart; and",5843
"5844",141,"as soon as she could notice this, and see that, in spite of the shock",5844
"5845",141,"of her words, he still kept his station and retained her sister’s hand,",5845
"5846",141,"her wounded heart swelled again with injury, and looking as red as she",5846
"5847",141,"had been white before, she turned out of the room, saying, “_I_ need",5847
"5848",141,"not be afraid of appearing before him.”",5848
"5849",141,"",5849
"5850",141,"Her going roused the rest; and at the same moment the two brothers",5850
"5851",141,"stepped forward, feeling the necessity of doing something. A very few",5851
"5852",141,"words between them were sufficient. The case admitted no difference of",5852
"5853",141,"opinion: they must go to the drawing-room directly. Maria joined them",5853
"5854",141,"with the same intent, just then the stoutest of the three; for the very",5854
"5855",141,"circumstance which had driven Julia away was to her the sweetest",5855
"5856",141,"support. Henry Crawford’s retaining her hand at such a moment, a moment",5856
"5857",141,"of such peculiar proof and importance, was worth ages of doubt and",5857
"5858",141,"anxiety. She hailed it as an earnest of the most serious determination,",5858
"5859",141,"and was equal even to encounter her father. They walked off, utterly",5859
"5860",141,"heedless of Mr. Rushworth’s repeated question of, “Shall I go too? Had",5860
"5861",141,"not I better go too? Will not it be right for me to go too?” but they",5861
"5862",141,"were no sooner through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answer",5862
"5863",141,"the anxious inquiry, and, encouraging him by all means to pay his",5863
"5864",141,"respects to Sir Thomas without delay, sent him after the others with",5864
"5865",141,"delighted haste.",5865
"5866",141,"",5866
"5867",141,"Fanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates. She had been",5867
"5868",141,"quite overlooked by her cousins; and as her own opinion of her claims",5868
"5869",141,"on Sir Thomas’s affection was much too humble to give her any idea of",5869
"5870",141,"classing herself with his children, she was glad to remain behind and",5870
"5871",141,"gain a little breathing-time. Her agitation and alarm exceeded all that",5871
"5872",141,"was endured by the rest, by the right of a disposition which not even",5872
"5873",141,"innocence could keep from suffering. She was nearly fainting: all her",5873
"5874",141,"former habitual dread of her uncle was returning, and with it",5874
"5875",141,"compassion for him and for almost every one of the party on the",5875
"5876",141,"development before him, with solicitude on Edmund’s account",5876
"5877",141,"indescribable. She had found a seat, where in excessive trembling she",5877
"5878",141,"was enduring all these fearful thoughts, while the other three, no",5878
"5879",141,"longer under any restraint, were giving vent to their feelings of",5879
"5880",141,"vexation, lamenting over such an unlooked-for premature arrival as a",5880
"5881",141,"most untoward event, and without mercy wishing poor Sir Thomas had been",5881
"5882",141,"twice as long on his passage, or were still in Antigua.",5882
"5883",141,"",5883
"5884",141,"The Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates, from better",5884
"5885",141,"understanding the family, and judging more clearly of the mischief that",5885
"5886",141,"must ensue. The ruin of the play was to them a certainty: they felt the",5886
"5887",141,"total destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand; while Mr.",5887
"5888",141,"Yates considered it only as a temporary interruption, a disaster for",5888
"5889",141,"the evening, and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal",5889
"5890",141,"being renewed after tea, when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were",5890
"5891",141,"over, and he might be at leisure to be amused by it. The Crawfords",5891
"5892",141,"laughed at the idea; and having soon agreed on the propriety of their",5892
"5893",141,"walking quietly home and leaving the family to themselves, proposed Mr.",5893
"5894",141,"Yates’s accompanying them and spending the evening at the Parsonage.",5894
"5895",141,"But Mr. Yates, having never been with those who thought much of",5895
"5896",141,"parental claims, or family confidence, could not perceive that anything",5896
"5897",141,"of the kind was necessary; and therefore, thanking them, said, “he",5897
"5898",141,"preferred remaining where he was, that he might pay his respects to the",5898
"5899",141,"old gentleman handsomely since he _was_ come; and besides, he did not",5899

"5901",141,"",5901
"5902",141,"Fanny was just beginning to collect herself, and to feel that if she",5902
"5903",141,"staid longer behind it might seem disrespectful, when this point was",5903
"5904",141,"settled, and being commissioned with the brother and sister’s apology,",5904
"5905",141,"saw them preparing to go as she quitted the room herself to perform the",5905

"5909",141,"pausing a moment for what she knew would not come, for a courage which",5909
"5910",141,"the outside of no door had ever supplied to her, she turned the lock in",5910
"5911",141,"desperation, and the lights of the drawing-room, and all the collected",5911
"5912",141,"family, were before her. As she entered, her own name caught her ear.",5912
"5913",141,"Sir Thomas was at that moment looking round him, and saying, “But where",5913
"5914",141,"is Fanny? Why do not I see my little Fanny?”—and on perceiving her,",5914
"5915",141,"came forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her,",5915
"5916",141,"calling her his dear Fanny, kissing her affectionately, and observing",5916
"5917",141,"with decided pleasure how much she was grown! Fanny knew not how to",5917
"5918",141,"feel, nor where to look. She was quite oppressed. He had never been so",5918
"5919",141,"kind, so _very_ kind to her in his life. His manner seemed changed, his",5919
"5920",141,"voice was quick from the agitation of joy; and all that had been awful",5920
"5921",141,"in his dignity seemed lost in tenderness. He led her nearer the light",5921
"5922",141,"and looked at her again—inquired particularly after her health, and",5922
"5923",141,"then, correcting himself, observed that he need not inquire, for her",5923
"5924",141,"appearance spoke sufficiently on that point. A fine blush having",5924
"5925",141,"succeeded the previous paleness of her face, he was justified in his",5925
"5926",141,"belief of her equal improvement in health and beauty. He inquired next",5926
"5927",141,"after her family, especially William: and his kindness altogether was",5927
"5928",141,"such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little, and",5928
"5929",141,"thinking his return a misfortune; and when, on having courage to lift",5929
"5930",141,"her eyes to his face, she saw that he was grown thinner, and had the",5930
"5931",141,"burnt, fagged, worn look of fatigue and a hot climate, every tender",5931
"5932",141,"feeling was increased, and she was miserable in considering how much",5932
"5933",141,"unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him.",5933
"5934",141,"",5934
"5935",141,"Sir Thomas was indeed the life of the party, who at his suggestion now",5935
"5936",141,"seated themselves round the fire. He had the best right to be the",5936
"5937",141,"talker; and the delight of his sensations in being again in his own",5937
"5938",141,"house, in the centre of his family, after such a separation, made him",5938
"5939",141,"communicative and chatty in a very unusual degree; and he was ready to",5939
"5940",141,"give every information as to his voyage, and answer every question of",5940
"5941",141,"his two sons almost before it was put. His business in Antigua had",5941
"5942",141,"latterly been prosperously rapid, and he came directly from Liverpool,",5942
"5943",141,"having had an opportunity of making his passage thither in a private",5943
"5944",141,"vessel, instead of waiting for the packet; and all the little",5944
"5945",141,"particulars of his proceedings and events, his arrivals and departures,",5945
"5946",141,"were most promptly delivered, as he sat by Lady Bertram and looked with",5946

"5960",141,"place her nearer agitation than she had been for the last twenty years.",5960
"5961",141,"She had been _almost_ fluttered for a few minutes, and still remained",5961

"5964",141,"She had no anxieties for anybody to cloud _her_ pleasure: her own time",5964

"5979",141,"cloak as her brother-in-law entered, she could hardly be said to shew",5979
"5980",141,"any sign of alarm; but she was vexed by the _manner_ of his return. It",5980
"5981",141,"had left her nothing to do. Instead of being sent for out of the room,",5981
"5982",141,"and seeing him first, and having to spread the happy news through the",5982
"5983",141,"house, Sir Thomas, with a very reasonable dependence, perhaps, on the",5983
"5984",141,"nerves of his wife and children, had sought no confidant but the",5984
"5985",141,"butler, and had been following him almost instantaneously into the",5985

"5988",141,"the thing unfolded; and was now trying to be in a bustle without having",5988
"5989",141,"anything to bustle about, and labouring to be important where nothing",5989
"5990",141,"was wanted but tranquillity and silence. Would Sir Thomas have",5990
"5991",141,"consented to eat, she might have gone to the housekeeper with",5991
"5992",141,"troublesome directions, and insulted the footmen with injunctions of",5992
"5993",141,"despatch; but Sir Thomas resolutely declined all dinner: he would take",5993
"5994",141,"nothing, nothing till tea came—he would rather wait for tea. Still Mrs.",5994
"5995",141,"Norris was at intervals urging something different; and in the most",5995
"5996",141,"interesting moment of his passage to England, when the alarm of a",5996
"5997",141,"French privateer was at the height, she burst through his recital with",5997
"5998",141,"the proposal of soup. “Sure, my dear Sir Thomas, a basin of soup would",5998

"6001",141,"Sir Thomas could not be provoked. “Still the same anxiety for",6001

"6023",141,"You will hear enough of it to-morrow, sir. We have just been trying, by",6023
"6024",141,"way of doing something, and amusing my mother, just within the last",6024
"6025",141,"week, to get up a few scenes, a mere trifle. We have had such incessant",6025
"6026",141,"rains almost since October began, that we have been nearly confined to",6026
"6027",141,"the house for days together. I have hardly taken out a gun since the",6027
"6028",141,"3rd. Tolerable sport the first three days, but there has been no",6028
"6029",141,"attempting anything since. The first day I went over Mansfield Wood,",6029
"6030",141,"and Edmund took the copses beyond Easton, and we brought home six brace",6030
"6031",141,"between us, and might each have killed six times as many, but we",6031
"6032",141,"respect your pheasants, sir, I assure you, as much as you could desire.",6032
"6033",141,"I do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than",6033
"6034",141,"they were. _I_ never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my life",6034
"6035",141,"as this year. I hope you will take a day’s sport there yourself, sir,",6035
"6036",141,"soon.”",6036
"6037",141,"",6037
"6038",141,"For the present the danger was over, and Fanny’s sick feelings",6038
"6039",141,"subsided; but when tea was soon afterwards brought in, and Sir Thomas,",6039
"6040",141,"getting up, said that he found that he could not be any longer in the",6040
"6041",141,"house without just looking into his own dear room, every agitation was",6041
"6042",141,"returning. He was gone before anything had been said to prepare him for",6042
"6043",141,"the change he must find there; and a pause of alarm followed his",6043
"6044",141,"disappearance. Edmund was the first to speak—",6044
"6045",141,"",6045
"6046",141,"“Something must be done,” said he.",6046
"6047",141,"",6047
"6048",141,"“It is time to think of our visitors,” said Maria, still feeling her",6048
"6049",141,"hand pressed to Henry Crawford’s heart, and caring little for anything",6049
"6050",141,"else. “Where did you leave Miss Crawford, Fanny?”",6050

"6056",141,"",6056
"6057",141,"To the theatre he went, and reached it just in time to witness the",6057
"6058",141,"first meeting of his father and his friend. Sir Thomas had been a good",6058
"6059",141,"deal surprised to find candles burning in his room; and on casting his",6059
"6060",141,"eye round it, to see other symptoms of recent habitation and a general",6060
"6061",141,"air of confusion in the furniture. The removal of the bookcase from",6061
"6062",141,"before the billiard-room door struck him especially, but he had",6062
"6063",141,"scarcely more than time to feel astonished at all this, before there",6063
"6064",141,"were sounds from the billiard-room to astonish him still farther. Some",6064
"6065",141,"one was talking there in a very loud accent; he did not know the",6065
"6066",141,"voice—more than talking—almost hallooing. He stepped to the door,",6066
"6067",141,"rejoicing at that moment in having the means of immediate",6067
"6068",141,"communication, and, opening it, found himself on the stage of a",6068
"6069",141,"theatre, and opposed to a ranting young man, who appeared likely to",6069
"6070",141,"knock him down backwards. At the very moment of Yates perceiving Sir",6070
"6071",141,"Thomas, and giving perhaps the very best start he had ever given in the",6071
"6072",141,"whole course of his rehearsals, Tom Bertram entered at the other end of",6072
"6073",141,"the room; and never had he found greater difficulty in keeping his",6073
"6074",141,"countenance. His father’s looks of solemnity and amazement on this his",6074
"6075",141,"first appearance on any stage, and the gradual metamorphosis of the",6075
"6076",141,"impassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well-bred and easy Mr. Yates,",6076
"6077",141,"making his bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram, was such an",6077
"6078",141,"exhibition, such a piece of true acting, as he would not have lost upon",6078
"6079",141,"any account. It would be the last—in all probability—the last scene on",6079
"6080",141,"that stage; but he was sure there could not be a finer. The house would",6080
"6081",141,"close with the greatest eclat.",6081
"6082",141,"",6082
"6083",141,"There was little time, however, for the indulgence of any images of",6083
"6084",141,"merriment. It was necessary for him to step forward, too, and assist",6084
"6085",141,"the introduction, and with many awkward sensations he did his best. Sir",6085
"6086",141,"Thomas received Mr. Yates with all the appearance of cordiality which",6086
"6087",141,"was due to his own character, but was really as far from pleased with",6087
"6088",141,"the necessity of the acquaintance as with the manner of its",6088
"6089",141,"commencement. Mr. Yates’s family and connexions were sufficiently known",6089
"6090",141,"to him to render his introduction as the “particular friend,” another",6090
"6091",141,"of the hundred particular friends of his son, exceedingly unwelcome;",6091
"6092",141,"and it needed all the felicity of being again at home, and all the",6092
"6093",141,"forbearance it could supply, to save Sir Thomas from anger on finding",6093
"6094",141,"himself thus bewildered in his own house, making part of a ridiculous",6094
"6095",141,"exhibition in the midst of theatrical nonsense, and forced in so",6095
"6096",141,"untoward a moment to admit the acquaintance of a young man whom he felt",6096
"6097",141,"sure of disapproving, and whose easy indifference and volubility in the",6097

"6101",141,"Tom understood his father’s thoughts, and heartily wishing he might be",6101
"6102",141,"always as well disposed to give them but partial expression, began to",6102
"6103",141,"see, more clearly than he had ever done before, that there might be",6103
"6104",141,"some ground of offence, that there might be some reason for the glance",6104
"6105",141,"his father gave towards the ceiling and stucco of the room; and that",6105
"6106",141,"when he inquired with mild gravity after the fate of the",6106
"6107",141,"billiard-table, he was not proceeding beyond a very allowable",6107
"6108",141,"curiosity. A few minutes were enough for such unsatisfactory sensations",6108
"6109",141,"on each side; and Sir Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak",6109
"6110",141,"a few words of calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of Mr.",6110
"6111",141,"Yates, as to the happiness of the arrangement, the three gentlemen",6111
"6112",141,"returned to the drawing-room together, Sir Thomas with an increase of",6112
"6113",141,"gravity which was not lost on all.",6113
"6114",141,"",6114
"6115",141,"“I come from your theatre,” said he composedly, as he sat down; “I",6115
"6116",141,"found myself in it rather unexpectedly. Its vicinity to my own room—but",6116
"6117",141,"in every respect, indeed, it took me by surprise, as I had not the",6117
"6118",141,"smallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a",6118
"6119",141,"character. It appears a neat job, however, as far as I could judge by",6119
"6120",141,"candlelight, and does my friend Christopher Jackson credit.” And then",6120
"6121",141,"he would have changed the subject, and sipped his coffee in peace over",6121
"6122",141,"domestic matters of a calmer hue; but Mr. Yates, without discernment to",6122
"6123",141,"catch Sir Thomas’s meaning, or diffidence, or delicacy, or discretion",6123
"6124",141,"enough to allow him to lead the discourse while he mingled among the",6124
"6125",141,"others with the least obtrusiveness himself, would keep him on the",6125
"6126",141,"topic of the theatre, would torment him with questions and remarks",6126
"6127",141,"relative to it, and finally would make him hear the whole history of",6127
"6128",141,"his disappointment at Ecclesford. Sir Thomas listened most politely,",6128
"6129",141,"but found much to offend his ideas of decorum, and confirm his",6129
"6130",141,"ill-opinion of Mr. Yates’s habits of thinking, from the beginning to",6130
"6131",141,"the end of the story; and when it was over, could give him no other",6131
"6132",141,"assurance of sympathy than what a slight bow conveyed.",6132

"6134",141,"“This was, in fact, the origin of _our_ acting,” said Tom, after a",6134
"6135",141,"moment’s thought. “My friend Yates brought the infection from",6135
"6136",141,"Ecclesford, and it spread—as those things always spread, you know,",6136
"6137",141,"sir—the faster, probably, from _your_ having so often encouraged the",6137
"6138",141,"sort of thing in us formerly. It was like treading old ground again.”",6138
"6139",141,"",6139
"6140",141,"Mr. Yates took the subject from his friend as soon as possible, and",6140
"6141",141,"immediately gave Sir Thomas an account of what they had done and were",6141
"6142",141,"doing: told him of the gradual increase of their views, the happy",6142
"6143",141,"conclusion of their first difficulties, and present promising state of",6143
"6144",141,"affairs; relating everything with so blind an interest as made him not",6144
"6145",141,"only totally unconscious of the uneasy movements of many of his friends",6145
"6146",141,"as they sat, the change of countenance, the fidget, the hem! of",6146
"6147",141,"unquietness, but prevented him even from seeing the expression of the",6147
"6148",141,"face on which his own eyes were fixed—from seeing Sir Thomas’s dark",6148
"6149",141,"brow contract as he looked with inquiring earnestness at his daughters",6149
"6150",141,"and Edmund, dwelling particularly on the latter, and speaking a",6150
"6151",141,"language, a remonstrance, a reproof, which _he_ felt at his heart. Not",6151
"6152",141,"less acutely was it felt by Fanny, who had edged back her chair behind",6152
"6153",141,"her aunt’s end of the sofa, and, screened from notice herself, saw all",6153
"6154",141,"that was passing before her. Such a look of reproach at Edmund from his",6154
"6155",141,"father she could never have expected to witness; and to feel that it",6155
"6156",141,"was in any degree deserved was an aggravation indeed. Sir Thomas’s look",6156
"6157",141,"implied, “On your judgment, Edmund, I depended; what have you been",6157
"6158",141,"about?” She knelt in spirit to her uncle, and her bosom swelled to",6158
"6159",141,"utter, “Oh, not to _him_! Look so to all the others, but not to _him_!”",6159
"6160",141,"",6160
"6161",141,"Mr. Yates was still talking. “To own the truth, Sir Thomas, we were in",6161
"6162",141,"the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening. We were going",6162
"6163",141,"through the three first acts, and not unsuccessfully upon the whole.",6163
"6164",141,"Our company is now so dispersed, from the Crawfords being gone home,",6164
"6165",141,"that nothing more can be done to-night; but if you will give us the",6165
"6166",141,"honour of your company to-morrow evening, I should not be afraid of the",6166
"6167",141,"result. We bespeak your indulgence, you understand, as young",6167

"6170",141,"“My indulgence shall be given, sir,” replied Sir Thomas gravely, “but",6170
"6171",141,"without any other rehearsal.” And with a relenting smile, he added, “I",6171
"6172",141,"come home to be happy and indulgent.” Then turning away towards any or",6172
"6173",141,"all of the rest, he tranquilly said, “Mr. and Miss Crawford were",6173
"6174",141,"mentioned in my last letters from Mansfield. Do you find them agreeable",6174
"6175",141,"acquaintance?”",6175

"6178",141,"without particular regard for either, without jealousy either in love",6178
"6179",141,"or acting, could speak very handsomely of both. “Mr. Crawford was a",6179
"6180",141,"most pleasant, gentleman-like man; his sister a sweet, pretty, elegant,",6180

"6199",141,"quick-sighted, and feel many scruples which my children do _not_ feel,",6199

"6201",141,"tranquillity, for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures, should much",6201

"6203",141,"favourable circumstance for yourself, and for everybody connected with",6203

"6223",141,"Edmund’s first object the next morning was to see his father alone, and",6223
"6224",141,"give him a fair statement of the whole acting scheme, defending his own",6224
"6225",141,"share in it as far only as he could then, in a soberer moment, feel his",6225
"6226",141,"motives to deserve, and acknowledging, with perfect ingenuousness, that",6226
"6227",141,"his concession had been attended with such partial good as to make his",6227
"6228",141,"judgment in it very doubtful. He was anxious, while vindicating",6228
"6229",141,"himself, to say nothing unkind of the others: but there was only one",6229
"6230",141,"amongst them whose conduct he could mention without some necessity of",6230
"6231",141,"defence or palliation. “We have all been more or less to blame,” said",6231
"6232",141,"he, “every one of us, excepting Fanny. Fanny is the only one who has",6232
"6233",141,"judged rightly throughout; who has been consistent. _Her_ feelings have",6233

"6236",141,"",6236
"6237",141,"Sir Thomas saw all the impropriety of such a scheme among such a party,",6237
"6238",141,"and at such a time, as strongly as his son had ever supposed he must;",6238
"6239",141,"he felt it too much, indeed, for many words; and having shaken hands",6239

"6241",141,"forget how much he had been forgotten himself as soon as he could,",6241
"6242",141,"after the house had been cleared of every object enforcing the",6242
"6243",141,"remembrance, and restored to its proper state. He did not enter into",6243
"6244",141,"any remonstrance with his other children: he was more willing to",6244
"6245",141,"believe they felt their error than to run the risk of investigation.",6245
"6246",141,"The reproof of an immediate conclusion of everything, the sweep of",6246
"6247",141,"every preparation, would be sufficient.",6247
"6248",141,"",6248
"6249",141,"There was one person, however, in the house, whom he could not leave to",6249
"6250",141,"learn his sentiments merely through his conduct. He could not help",6250
"6251",141,"giving Mrs. Norris a hint of his having hoped that her advice might",6251
"6252",141,"have been interposed to prevent what her judgment must certainly have",6252
"6253",141,"disapproved. The young people had been very inconsiderate in forming",6253
"6254",141,"the plan; they ought to have been capable of a better decision",6254
"6255",141,"themselves; but they were young; and, excepting Edmund, he believed, of",6255
"6256",141,"unsteady characters; and with greater surprise, therefore, he must",6256
"6257",141,"regard her acquiescence in their wrong measures, her countenance of",6257
"6258",141,"their unsafe amusements, than that such measures and such amusements",6258
"6259",141,"should have been suggested. Mrs. Norris was a little confounded and as",6259
"6260",141,"nearly being silenced as ever she had been in her life; for she was",6260
"6261",141,"ashamed to confess having never seen any of the impropriety which was",6261
"6262",141,"so glaring to Sir Thomas, and would not have admitted that her",6262
"6263",141,"influence was insufficient—that she might have talked in vain. Her only",6263
"6264",141,"resource was to get out of the subject as fast as possible, and turn",6264
"6265",141,"the current of Sir Thomas’s ideas into a happier channel. She had a",6265
"6266",141,"great deal to insinuate in her own praise as to _general_ attention to",6266
"6267",141,"the interest and comfort of his family, much exertion and many",6267
"6268",141,"sacrifices to glance at in the form of hurried walks and sudden",6268
"6269",141,"removals from her own fireside, and many excellent hints of distrust",6269
"6270",141,"and economy to Lady Bertram and Edmund to detail, whereby a most",6270
"6271",141,"considerable saving had always arisen, and more than one bad servant",6271
"6272",141,"been detected. But her chief strength lay in Sotherton. Her greatest",6272
"6273",141,"support and glory was in having formed the connexion with the",6273
"6274",141,"Rushworths. _There_ she was impregnable. She took to herself all the",6274
"6275",141,"credit of bringing Mr. Rushworth’s admiration of Maria to any effect.",6275
"6276",141,"“If I had not been active,” said she, “and made a point of being",6276

"6283",141,"persuade her. You know the distance to Sotherton; it was in the middle",6283

"6304",141,"about Stoke, where, what with frost and snow upon beds of stones, it",6304

"6338",141,"examine and compute, and, in the intervals of business, to walk into",6338
"6339",141,"his stables and his gardens, and nearest plantations; but active and",6339
"6340",141,"methodical, he had not only done all this before he resumed his seat as",6340
"6341",141,"master of the house at dinner, he had also set the carpenter to work in",6341
"6342",141,"pulling down what had been so lately put up in the billiard-room, and",6342

"6346",141,"ruined all the coachman’s sponges, and made five of the under-servants",6346
"6347",141,"idle and dissatisfied; and Sir Thomas was in hopes that another day or",6347
"6348",141,"two would suffice to wipe away every outward memento of what had been,",6348
"6349",141,"even to the destruction of every unbound copy of Lovers’ Vows in the",6349
"6350",141,"house, for he was burning all that met his eye.",6350
"6351",141,"",6351
"6352",141,"Mr. Yates was beginning now to understand Sir Thomas’s intentions,",6352
"6353",141,"though as far as ever from understanding their source. He and his",6353
"6354",141,"friend had been out with their guns the chief of the morning, and Tom",6354
"6355",141,"had taken the opportunity of explaining, with proper apologies for his",6355
"6356",141,"father’s particularity, what was to be expected. Mr. Yates felt it as",6356
"6357",141,"acutely as might be supposed. To be a second time disappointed in the",6357
"6358",141,"same way was an instance of very severe ill-luck; and his indignation",6358
"6359",141,"was such, that had it not been for delicacy towards his friend, and his",6359
"6360",141,"friend’s youngest sister, he believed he should certainly attack the",6360
"6361",141,"baronet on the absurdity of his proceedings, and argue him into a",6361
"6362",141,"little more rationality. He believed this very stoutly while he was in",6362
"6363",141,"Mansfield Wood, and all the way home; but there was a something in Sir",6363
"6364",141,"Thomas, when they sat round the same table, which made Mr. Yates think",6364
"6365",141,"it wiser to let him pursue his own way, and feel the folly of it",6365
"6366",141,"without opposition. He had known many disagreeable fathers before, and",6366
"6367",141,"often been struck with the inconveniences they occasioned, but never,",6367
"6368",141,"in the whole course of his life, had he seen one of that class so",6368
"6369",141,"unintelligibly moral, so infamously tyrannical as Sir Thomas. He was",6369
"6370",141,"not a man to be endured but for his children’s sake, and he might be",6370
"6371",141,"thankful to his fair daughter Julia that Mr. Yates did yet mean to stay",6371
"6372",141,"a few days longer under his roof.",6372
"6373",141,"",6373
"6374",141,"The evening passed with external smoothness, though almost every mind",6374
"6375",141,"was ruffled; and the music which Sir Thomas called for from his",6375
"6376",141,"daughters helped to conceal the want of real harmony. Maria was in a",6376
"6377",141,"good deal of agitation. It was of the utmost consequence to her that",6377
"6378",141,"Crawford should now lose no time in declaring himself, and she was",6378
"6379",141,"disturbed that even a day should be gone by without seeming to advance",6379
"6380",141,"that point. She had been expecting to see him the whole morning, and",6380
"6381",141,"all the evening, too, was still expecting him. Mr. Rushworth had set",6381
"6382",141,"off early with the great news for Sotherton; and she had fondly hoped",6382
"6383",141,"for such an immediate _eclaircissement_ as might save him the trouble",6383
"6384",141,"of ever coming back again. But they had seen no one from the Parsonage,",6384
"6385",141,"not a creature, and had heard no tidings beyond a friendly note of",6385
"6386",141,"congratulation and inquiry from Mrs. Grant to Lady Bertram. It was the",6386
"6387",141,"first day for many, many weeks, in which the families had been wholly",6387
"6388",141,"divided. Four-and-twenty hours had never passed before, since August",6388
"6389",141,"began, without bringing them together in some way or other. It was a",6389
"6390",141,"sad, anxious day; and the morrow, though differing in the sort of evil,",6390
"6391",141,"did by no means bring less. A few moments of feverish enjoyment were",6391
"6392",141,"followed by hours of acute suffering. Henry Crawford was again in the",6392
"6393",141,"house: he walked up with Dr. Grant, who was anxious to pay his respects",6393
"6394",141,"to Sir Thomas, and at rather an early hour they were ushered into the",6394
"6395",141,"breakfast-room, where were most of the family. Sir Thomas soon",6395
"6396",141,"appeared, and Maria saw with delight and agitation the introduction of",6396
"6397",141,"the man she loved to her father. Her sensations were indefinable, and",6397
"6398",141,"so were they a few minutes afterwards upon hearing Henry Crawford, who",6398
"6399",141,"had a chair between herself and Tom, ask the latter in an undervoice",6399
"6400",141,"whether there were any plans for resuming the play after the present",6400
"6401",141,"happy interruption (with a courteous glance at Sir Thomas), because, in",6401
"6402",141,"that case, he should make a point of returning to Mansfield at any time",6402
"6403",141,"required by the party: he was going away immediately, being to meet his",6403
"6404",141,"uncle at Bath without delay; but if there were any prospect of a",6404
"6405",141,"renewal of Lovers’ Vows, he should hold himself positively engaged, he",6405
"6406",141,"should break through every other claim, he should absolutely condition",6406
"6407",141,"with his uncle for attending them whenever he might be wanted. The play",6407
"6408",141,"should not be lost by _his_ absence.",6408
"6409",141,"",6409
"6410",141,"“From Bath, Norfolk, London, York, wherever I may be,” said he; “I will",6410
"6411",141,"attend you from any place in England, at an hour’s notice.”",6411
"6412",141,"",6412
"6413",141,"It was well at that moment that Tom had to speak, and not his sister.",6413
"6414",141,"He could immediately say with easy fluency, “I am sorry you are going;",6414
"6415",141,"but as to our play, _that_ is all over—entirely at an end” (looking",6415
"6416",141,"significantly at his father). “The painter was sent off yesterday, and",6416
"6417",141,"very little will remain of the theatre to-morrow. I knew how _that_",6417
"6418",141,"would be from the first. It is early for Bath. You will find nobody",6418

"6427",141,"“Whose stables do you use at Bath?” was the next question; and while",6427
"6428",141,"this branch of the subject was under discussion, Maria, who wanted",6428
"6429",141,"neither pride nor resolution, was preparing to encounter her share of",6429
"6430",141,"it with tolerable calmness.",6430
"6431",141,"",6431
"6432",141,"To her he soon turned, repeating much of what he had already said, with",6432
"6433",141,"only a softened air and stronger expressions of regret. But what",6433
"6434",141,"availed his expressions or his air? He was going, and, if not",6434
"6435",141,"voluntarily going, voluntarily intending to stay away; for, excepting",6435
"6436",141,"what might be due to his uncle, his engagements were all self-imposed.",6436
"6437",141,"He might talk of necessity, but she knew his independence. The hand",6437
"6438",141,"which had so pressed hers to his heart! the hand and the heart were",6438
"6439",141,"alike motionless and passive now! Her spirit supported her, but the",6439
"6440",141,"agony of her mind was severe. She had not long to endure what arose",6440
"6441",141,"from listening to language which his actions contradicted, or to bury",6441
"6442",141,"the tumult of her feelings under the restraint of society; for general",6442
"6443",141,"civilities soon called his notice from her, and the farewell visit, as",6443
"6444",141,"it then became openly acknowledged, was a very short one. He was",6444
"6445",141,"gone—he had touched her hand for the last time, he had made his parting",6445
"6446",141,"bow, and she might seek directly all that solitude could do for her.",6446
"6447",141,"Henry Crawford was gone, gone from the house, and within two hours",6447
"6448",141,"afterwards from the parish; and so ended all the hopes his selfish",6448
"6449",141,"vanity had raised in Maria and Julia Bertram.",6449
"6450",141,"",6450
"6451",141,"Julia could rejoice that he was gone. His presence was beginning to be",6451
"6452",141,"odious to her; and if Maria gained him not, she was now cool enough to",6452
"6453",141,"dispense with any other revenge. She did not want exposure to be added",6453
"6454",141,"to desertion. Henry Crawford gone, she could even pity her sister.",6454
"6455",141,"",6455
"6456",141,"With a purer spirit did Fanny rejoice in the intelligence. She heard it",6456
"6457",141,"at dinner, and felt it a blessing. By all the others it was mentioned",6457
"6458",141,"with regret; and his merits honoured with due gradation of feeling—from",6458
"6459",141,"the sincerity of Edmund’s too partial regard, to the unconcern of his",6459
"6460",141,"mother speaking entirely by rote. Mrs. Norris began to look about her,",6460
"6461",141,"and wonder that his falling in love with Julia had come to nothing; and",6461
"6462",141,"could almost fear that she had been remiss herself in forwarding it;",6462
"6463",141,"but with so many to care for, how was it possible for even _her_",6463
"6464",141,"activity to keep pace with her wishes?",6464

"6466",141,"Another day or two, and Mr. Yates was gone likewise. In _his_ departure",6466
"6467",141,"Sir Thomas felt the chief interest: wanting to be alone with his",6467
"6468",141,"family, the presence of a stranger superior to Mr. Yates must have been",6468
"6469",141,"irksome; but of him, trifling and confident, idle and expensive, it was",6469
"6470",141,"every way vexatious. In himself he was wearisome, but as the friend of",6470
"6471",141,"Tom and the admirer of Julia he became offensive. Sir Thomas had been",6471
"6472",141,"quite indifferent to Mr. Crawford’s going or staying: but his good",6472
"6473",141,"wishes for Mr. Yates’s having a pleasant journey, as he walked with him",6473
"6474",141,"to the hall-door, were given with genuine satisfaction. Mr. Yates had",6474
"6475",141,"staid to see the destruction of every theatrical preparation at",6475
"6476",141,"Mansfield, the removal of everything appertaining to the play: he left",6476
"6477",141,"the house in all the soberness of its general character; and Sir Thomas",6477
"6478",141,"hoped, in seeing him out of it, to be rid of the worst object connected",6478

"6491",141,"",6491
"6492",141,"",6492
"6493",141,"Sir Thomas’s return made a striking change in the ways of the family,",6493
"6494",141,"independent of Lovers’ Vows. Under his government, Mansfield was an",6494
"6495",141,"altered place. Some members of their society sent away, and the spirits",6495
"6496",141,"of many others saddened—it was all sameness and gloom compared with the",6496
"6497",141,"past—a sombre family party rarely enlivened. There was little",6497
"6498",141,"intercourse with the Parsonage. Sir Thomas, drawing back from",6498
"6499",141,"intimacies in general, was particularly disinclined, at this time, for",6499
"6500",141,"any engagements but in one quarter. The Rushworths were the only",6500
"6501",141,"addition to his own domestic circle which he could solicit.",6501
"6502",141,"",6502
"6503",141,"Edmund did not wonder that such should be his father’s feelings, nor",6503
"6504",141,"could he regret anything but the exclusion of the Grants. “But they,”",6504
"6505",141,"he observed to Fanny, “have a claim. They seem to belong to us; they",6505
"6506",141,"seem to be part of ourselves. I could wish my father were more sensible",6506
"6507",141,"of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was",6507
"6508",141,"away. I am afraid they may feel themselves neglected. But the truth is,",6508
"6509",141,"that my father hardly knows them. They had not been here a twelvemonth",6509
"6510",141,"when he left England. If he knew them better, he would value their",6510
"6511",141,"society as it deserves; for they are in fact exactly the sort of people",6511
"6512",141,"he would like. We are sometimes a little in want of animation among",6512
"6513",141,"ourselves: my sisters seem out of spirits, and Tom is certainly not at",6513
"6514",141,"his ease. Dr. and Mrs. Grant would enliven us, and make our evenings",6514
"6515",141,"pass away with more enjoyment even to my father.”",6515
"6516",141,"",6516
"6517",141,"“Do you think so?” said Fanny: “in my opinion, my uncle would not like",6517
"6518",141,"_any_ addition. I think he values the very quietness you speak of, and",6518
"6519",141,"that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants. And it does",6519
"6520",141,"not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be—I mean",6520
"6521",141,"before my uncle went abroad. As well as I can recollect, it was always",6521
"6522",141,"much the same. There was never much laughing in his presence; or, if",6522
"6523",141,"there is any difference, it is not more, I think, than such an absence",6523
"6524",141,"has a tendency to produce at first. There must be a sort of shyness;",6524
"6525",141,"but I cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry,",6525
"6526",141,"except when my uncle was in town. No young people’s are, I suppose,",6526
"6527",141,"when those they look up to are at home”.",6527
"6528",141,"",6528
"6529",141,"“I believe you are right, Fanny,” was his reply, after a short",6529
"6530",141,"consideration. “I believe our evenings are rather returned to what they",6530
"6531",141,"were, than assuming a new character. The novelty was in their being",6531
"6532",141,"lively. Yet, how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give!",6532
"6533",141,"I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before.”",6533
"6534",141,"",6534
"6535",141,"“I suppose I am graver than other people,” said Fanny. “The evenings do",6535
"6536",141,"not appear long to me. I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies.",6536
"6537",141,"I could listen to him for an hour together. It entertains _me_ more",6537
"6538",141,"than many other things have done; but then I am unlike other people, I",6538
"6539",141,"dare say.”",6539
"6540",141,"",6540
"6541",141,"“Why should you dare say _that_?” (smiling). “Do you want to be told",6541
"6542",141,"that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet?",6542

"6652",141,"connexion entirely given up, if she felt herself unhappy in the",6652

"6672",141,"could dispense with seeing her husband a leading, shining character,",6672
"6673",141,"there would certainly be everything else in her favour. A well-disposed",6673
"6674",141,"young woman, who did not marry for love, was in general but the more",6674

"6706",141,"independence and splendour, for _his_ sake. Independence was more",6706

"6711",141,"possible, and find consolation in fortune and consequence, bustle and",6711

"6819",141,"sound of a little bustle at the front door, and the sight of Miss Price",6819
"6820",141,"dripping with wet in the vestibule, was delightful. The value of an",6820
"6821",141,"event on a wet day in the country was most forcibly brought before her.",6821
"6822",141,"She was all alive again directly, and among the most active in being",6822
"6823",141,"useful to Fanny, in detecting her to be wetter than she would at first",6823
"6824",141,"allow, and providing her with dry clothes; and Fanny, after being",6824
"6825",141,"obliged to submit to all this attention, and to being assisted and",6825
"6826",141,"waited on by mistresses and maids, being also obliged, on returning",6826
"6827",141,"downstairs, to be fixed in their drawing-room for an hour while the",6827
"6828",141,"rain continued, the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was",6828

"6836",141,"carriage and horses out to take her home, with which she was",6836
"6837",141,"threatened. As to anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such",6837
"6838",141,"weather might occasion at home, she had nothing to suffer on that",6838
"6839",141,"score; for as her being out was known only to her two aunts, she was",6839
"6840",141,"perfectly aware that none would be felt, and that in whatever cottage",6840

"6858",141,"who shewed herself not wanting in taste. She played till Fanny’s eyes,",6858
"6859",141,"straying to the window on the weather’s being evidently fair, spoke",6859

"6889",141,"intimacy resulting principally from Miss Crawford’s desire of something",6889
"6890",141,"new, and which had little reality in Fanny’s feelings. Fanny went to",6890
"6891",141,"her every two or three days: it seemed a kind of fascination: she could",6891

"6896",141,"often at the expense of her judgment, when it was raised by pleasantry",6896

"6899",141,"Grant’s shrubbery, the weather being unusually mild for the time of",6899
"6900",141,"year, and venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of the benches",6900
"6901",141,"now comparatively unsheltered, remaining there perhaps till, in the",6901
"6902",141,"midst of some tender ejaculation of Fanny’s on the sweets of so",6902

"6914",141,"another three years, we may be forgetting—almost forgetting what it was",6914
"6915",141,"before. How wonderful, how very wonderful the operations of time, and",6915
"6916",141,"the changes of the human mind!” And following the latter train of",6916
"6917",141,"thought, she soon afterwards added: “If any one faculty of our nature",6917
"6918",141,"may be called _more_ wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory.",6918

"6922",141,"obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so",6922
"6923",141,"tyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way;",6923

"6935",141,"“Yes,” replied Miss Crawford carelessly, “it does very well for a place",6935

"6944",141,"When one thinks of it, how astonishing a variety of nature! In some",6944

"6949",141,"especially when I am sitting out of doors, I am very apt to get into",6949

"6955",141,"famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV.; and may declare that I see no",6955

"6975",141,"_half_ the year in the country, under certain circumstances, very",6975
"6976",141,"pleasant. An elegant, moderate-sized house in the centre of family",6976

"6981",141,"person one feels most agreeable in the world. There is nothing",6981
"6982",141,"frightful in such a picture, is there, Miss Price? One need not envy",6982

"7003",141,"character! It just stands for a gentleman, and that’s all. But there is",7003
"7004",141,"nobleness in the name of Edmund. It is a name of heroism and renown; of",7004

"7147",141,"was quickened, and they all accompanied her into the house, through",7147
"7148",141,"which it was necessary to pass. Dr. Grant was in the vestibule, and as",7148
"7149",141,"they stopt to speak to him she found, from Edmund’s manner, that he",7149
"7150",141,"_did_ mean to go with her. He too was taking leave. She could not but",7150

"7152",141,"to eat his mutton with him the next day; and Fanny had barely time for",7152
"7153",141,"an unpleasant feeling on the occasion, when Mrs. Grant, with sudden",7153
"7154",141,"recollection, turned to her and asked for the pleasure of her company",7154

"7157",141,"embarrassment; and while stammering out her great obligation, and her",7157
"7158",141,"“but she did not suppose it would be in her power,” was looking at",7158

"7160",141,"such an happiness offered, and ascertaining with half a look, and half",7160
"7161",141,"a sentence, that she had no objection but on her aunt’s account, could",7161
"7162",141,"not imagine that his mother would make any difficulty of sparing her,",7162

"7238",141,"herself the subject of any discussion with her uncle was more than her",7238

"7268",141,"answer. She appears to feel as she ought. But as I conclude that she",7268

"7302",141,"directed her taste; for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to",7302

"7316",141,"to your uncle and aunt and me. Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to",7316

"7382",141,"in what might seem a state of triumph, she followed her uncle out of",7382

"7445",141,"Mrs. Grant, as to leave her the fairest prospect of having only to",7445

"7453",141,"the open weather, but her answers were as short and indifferent as",7453

"8055",141,"on that side, where the view is really very pretty; I am sure it may be",8055
"8056",141,"done. And _there_ must be your approach, through what is at present the",8056

"8092",141,"(Excuse me, your ladyship must not see your cards. There, let them lie",8092

"8094",141,"the air of a gentleman’s residence. _That_ will be done by the removal",8094
"8095",141,"of the farmyard; for, independent of that terrible nuisance, I never",8095
"8096",141,"saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a",8096
"8097",141,"gentleman’s residence, so much the look of a something above a mere",8097
"8098",141,"parsonage-house—above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year. It is",8098
"8099",141,"not a scrambling collection of low single rooms, with as many roofs as",8099
"8100",141,"windows; it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square",8100
"8101",141,"farmhouse: it is a solid, roomy, mansion-like looking house, such as",8101
"8102",141,"one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from",8102
"8103",141,"generation to generation, through two centuries at least, and were now",8103
"8104",141,"spending from two to three thousand a year in.” Miss Crawford listened,",8104
"8105",141,"and Edmund agreed to this. “The air of a gentleman’s residence,",8105
"8106",141,"therefore, you cannot but give it, if you do anything. But it is",8106
"8107",141,"capable of much more. (Let me see, Mary; Lady Bertram bids a dozen for",8107
"8108",141,"that queen; no, no, a dozen is more than it is worth. Lady Bertram does",8108
"8109",141,"not bid a dozen. She will have nothing to say to it. Go on, go on.) By",8109
"8110",141,"some such improvements as I have suggested (I do not really require you",8110
"8111",141,"to proceed upon my plan, though, by the bye, I doubt anybody’s striking",8111
"8112",141,"out a better) you may give it a higher character. You may raise it into",8112
"8113",141,"a _place_. From being the mere gentleman’s residence, it becomes, by",8113
"8114",141,"judicious improvement, the residence of a man of education, taste,",8114
"8115",141,"modern manners, good connexions. All this may be stamped on it; and",8115
"8116",141,"that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the",8116
"8117",141,"great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road;",8117

"8432",141,"have to do the honours of the evening; and this reflection quickly",8432
"8433",141,"restored so much of her good-humour as enabled her to join in with the",8433
"8434",141,"others, before their happiness and thanks were all expressed.",8434
"8435",141,"",8435
"8436",141,"Edmund, William, and Fanny did, in their different ways, look and speak",8436
"8437",141,"as much grateful pleasure in the promised ball as Sir Thomas could",8437
"8438",141,"desire. Edmund’s feelings were for the other two. His father had never",8438

"8440",141,"",8440
"8441",141,"Lady Bertram was perfectly quiescent and contented, and had no",8441
"8442",141,"objections to make. Sir Thomas engaged for its giving her very little",8442
"8443",141,"trouble; and she assured him “that she was not at all afraid of the",8443
"8444",141,"trouble; indeed, she could not imagine there would be any.”",8444
"8445",141,"",8445
"8446",141,"Mrs. Norris was ready with her suggestions as to the rooms he would",8446
"8447",141,"think fittest to be used, but found it all prearranged; and when she",8447
"8448",141,"would have conjectured and hinted about the day, it appeared that the",8448
"8449",141,"day was settled too. Sir Thomas had been amusing himself with shaping a",8449
"8450",141,"very complete outline of the business; and as soon as she would listen",8450
"8451",141,"quietly, could read his list of the families to be invited, from whom",8451
"8452",141,"he calculated, with all necessary allowance for the shortness of the",8452
"8453",141,"notice, to collect young people enough to form twelve or fourteen",8453
"8454",141,"couple: and could detail the considerations which had induced him to",8454
"8455",141,"fix on the 22nd as the most eligible day. William was required to be at",8455
"8456",141,"Portsmouth on the 24th; the 22nd would therefore be the last day of his",8456
"8457",141,"visit; but where the days were so few it would be unwise to fix on any",8457
"8458",141,"earlier. Mrs. Norris was obliged to be satisfied with thinking just the",8458
"8459",141,"same, and with having been on the point of proposing the 22nd herself,",8459
"8460",141,"as by far the best day for the purpose.",8460
"8461",141,"",8461
"8462",141,"The ball was now a settled thing, and before the evening a proclaimed",8462
"8463",141,"thing to all whom it concerned. Invitations were sent with despatch,",8463
"8464",141,"and many a young lady went to bed that night with her head full of",8464
"8465",141,"happy cares as well as Fanny. To her the cares were sometimes almost",8465
"8466",141,"beyond the happiness; for young and inexperienced, with small means of",8466
"8467",141,"choice and no confidence in her own taste, the “how she should be",8467
"8468",141,"dressed” was a point of painful solicitude; and the almost solitary",8468
"8469",141,"ornament in her possession, a very pretty amber cross which William had",8469
"8470",141,"brought her from Sicily, was the greatest distress of all, for she had",8470
"8471",141,"nothing but a bit of ribbon to fasten it to; and though she had worn it",8471
"8472",141,"in that manner once, would it be allowable at such a time in the midst",8472
"8473",141,"of all the rich ornaments which she supposed all the other young ladies",8473
"8474",141,"would appear in? And yet not to wear it! William had wanted to buy her",8474
"8475",141,"a gold chain too, but the purchase had been beyond his means, and",8475
"8476",141,"therefore not to wear the cross might be mortifying him. These were",8476
"8477",141,"anxious considerations; enough to sober her spirits even under the",8477
"8478",141,"prospect of a ball given principally for her gratification.",8478
"8479",141,"",8479
"8480",141,"The preparations meanwhile went on, and Lady Bertram continued to sit",8480
"8481",141,"on her sofa without any inconvenience from them. She had some extra",8481
"8482",141,"visits from the housekeeper, and her maid was rather hurried in making",8482
"8483",141,"up a new dress for her: Sir Thomas gave orders, and Mrs. Norris ran",8483
"8484",141,"about; but all this gave _her_ no trouble, and as she had foreseen,",8484
"8485",141,"“there was, in fact, no trouble in the business.”",8485
"8486",141,"",8486
"8487",141,"Edmund was at this time particularly full of cares: his mind being",8487
"8488",141,"deeply occupied in the consideration of two important events now at",8488
"8489",141,"hand, which were to fix his fate in life—ordination and",8489
"8490",141,"matrimony—events of such a serious character as to make the ball, which",8490
"8491",141,"would be very quickly followed by one of them, appear of less moment in",8491
"8492",141,"his eyes than in those of any other person in the house. On the 23rd he",8492
"8493",141,"was going to a friend near Peterborough, in the same situation as",8493
"8494",141,"himself, and they were to receive ordination in the course of the",8494
"8495",141,"Christmas week. Half his destiny would then be determined, but the",8495
"8496",141,"other half might not be so very smoothly wooed. His duties would be",8496
"8497",141,"established, but the wife who was to share, and animate, and reward",8497
"8498",141,"those duties, might yet be unattainable. He knew his own mind, but he",8498
"8499",141,"was not always perfectly assured of knowing Miss Crawford’s. There were",8499
"8500",141,"points on which they did not quite agree; there were moments in which",8500
"8501",141,"she did not seem propitious; and though trusting altogether to her",8501
"8502",141,"affection, so far as to be resolved—almost resolved—on bringing it to a",8502
"8503",141,"decision within a very short time, as soon as the variety of business",8503
"8504",141,"before him were arranged, and he knew what he had to offer her, he had",8504
"8505",141,"many anxious feelings, many doubting hours as to the result. His",8505
"8506",141,"conviction of her regard for him was sometimes very strong; he could",8506
"8507",141,"look back on a long course of encouragement, and she was as perfect in",8507
"8508",141,"disinterested attachment as in everything else. But at other times",8508
"8509",141,"doubt and alarm intermingled with his hopes; and when he thought of her",8509
"8510",141,"acknowledged disinclination for privacy and retirement, her decided",8510
"8511",141,"preference of a London life, what could he expect but a determined",8511
"8512",141,"rejection? unless it were an acceptance even more to be deprecated,",8512
"8513",141,"demanding such sacrifices of situation and employment on his side as",8513
"8514",141,"conscience must forbid.",8514
"8515",141,"",8515
"8516",141,"The issue of all depended on one question. Did she love him well enough",8516
"8517",141,"to forego what had used to be essential points? Did she love him well",8517
"8518",141,"enough to make them no longer essential? And this question, which he",8518
"8519",141,"was continually repeating to himself, though oftenest answered with a",8519
"8520",141,"“Yes,” had sometimes its “No.”",8520
"8521",141,"",8521
"8522",141,"Miss Crawford was soon to leave Mansfield, and on this circumstance the",8522
"8523",141,"“no” and the “yes” had been very recently in alternation. He had seen",8523
"8524",141,"her eyes sparkle as she spoke of the dear friend’s letter, which",8524
"8525",141,"claimed a long visit from her in London, and of the kindness of Henry,",8525
"8526",141,"in engaging to remain where he was till January, that he might convey",8526
"8527",141,"her thither; he had heard her speak of the pleasure of such a journey",8527
"8528",141,"with an animation which had “no” in every tone. But this had occurred",8528
"8529",141,"on the first day of its being settled, within the first hour of the",8529
"8530",141,"burst of such enjoyment, when nothing but the friends she was to visit",8530
"8531",141,"was before her. He had since heard her express herself differently,",8531
"8532",141,"with other feelings, more chequered feelings: he had heard her tell",8532
"8533",141,"Mrs. Grant that she should leave her with regret; that she began to",8533
"8534",141,"believe neither the friends nor the pleasures she was going to were",8534
"8535",141,"worth those she left behind; and that though she felt she must go, and",8535
"8536",141,"knew she should enjoy herself when once away, she was already looking",8536
"8537",141,"forward to being at Mansfield again. Was there not a “yes” in all this?",8537
"8538",141,"",8538
"8539",141,"With such matters to ponder over, and arrange, and re-arrange, Edmund",8539
"8540",141,"could not, on his own account, think very much of the evening which the",8540
"8541",141,"rest of the family were looking forward to with a more equal degree of",8541
"8542",141,"strong interest. Independent of his two cousins’ enjoyment in it, the",8542
"8543",141,"evening was to him of no higher value than any other appointed meeting",8543
"8544",141,"of the two families might be. In every meeting there was a hope of",8544
"8545",141,"receiving farther confirmation of Miss Crawford’s attachment; but the",8545
"8546",141,"whirl of a ballroom, perhaps, was not particularly favourable to the",8546
"8547",141,"excitement or expression of serious feelings. To engage her early for",8547
"8548",141,"the two first dances was all the command of individual happiness which",8548
"8549",141,"he felt in his power, and the only preparation for the ball which he",8549
"8550",141,"could enter into, in spite of all that was passing around him on the",8550
"8551",141,"subject, from morning till night.",8551
"8552",141,"",8552
"8553",141,"Thursday was the day of the ball; and on Wednesday morning Fanny, still",8553
"8554",141,"unable to satisfy herself as to what she ought to wear, determined to",8554
"8555",141,"seek the counsel of the more enlightened, and apply to Mrs. Grant and",8555
"8556",141,"her sister, whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her",8556
"8557",141,"blameless; and as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton, and she",8557
"8558",141,"had reason to think Mr. Crawford likewise out, she walked down to the",8558
"8559",141,"Parsonage without much fear of wanting an opportunity for private",8559
"8560",141,"discussion; and the privacy of such a discussion was a most important",8560
"8561",141,"part of it to Fanny, being more than half-ashamed of her own",8561
"8562",141,"solicitude.",8562
"8563",141,"",8563
"8564",141,"She met Miss Crawford within a few yards of the Parsonage, just setting",8564
"8565",141,"out to call on her, and as it seemed to her that her friend, though",8565
"8566",141,"obliged to insist on turning back, was unwilling to lose her walk, she",8566
"8567",141,"explained her business at once, and observed, that if she would be so",8567
"8568",141,"kind as to give her opinion, it might be all talked over as well",8568
"8569",141,"without doors as within. Miss Crawford appeared gratified by the",8569
"8570",141,"application, and after a moment’s thought, urged Fanny’s returning with",8570
"8571",141,"her in a much more cordial manner than before, and proposed their going",8571
"8572",141,"up into her room, where they might have a comfortable coze, without",8572
"8573",141,"disturbing Dr. and Mrs. Grant, who were together in the drawing-room.",8573
"8574",141,"It was just the plan to suit Fanny; and with a great deal of gratitude",8574
"8575",141,"on her side for such ready and kind attention, they proceeded indoors,",8575
"8576",141,"and upstairs, and were soon deep in the interesting subject. Miss",8576
"8577",141,"Crawford, pleased with the appeal, gave her all her best judgment and",8577
"8578",141,"taste, made everything easy by her suggestions, and tried to make",8578
"8579",141,"everything agreeable by her encouragement. The dress being settled in",8579
"8580",141,"all its grander parts—“But what shall you have by way of necklace?”",8580
"8581",141,"said Miss Crawford. “Shall not you wear your brother’s cross?” And as",8581
"8582",141,"she spoke she was undoing a small parcel, which Fanny had observed in",8582
"8583",141,"her hand when they met. Fanny acknowledged her wishes and doubts on",8583
"8584",141,"this point: she did not know how either to wear the cross, or to",8584
"8585",141,"refrain from wearing it. She was answered by having a small trinket-box",8585
"8586",141,"placed before her, and being requested to chuse from among several gold",8586
"8587",141,"chains and necklaces. Such had been the parcel with which Miss Crawford",8587
"8588",141,"was provided, and such the object of her intended visit: and in the",8588
"8589",141,"kindest manner she now urged Fanny’s taking one for the cross and to",8589
"8590",141,"keep for her sake, saying everything she could think of to obviate the",8590
"8591",141,"scruples which were making Fanny start back at first with a look of",8591
"8592",141,"horror at the proposal.",8592
"8593",141,"",8593
"8594",141,"“You see what a collection I have,” said she; “more by half than I ever",8594
"8595",141,"use or think of. I do not offer them as new. I offer nothing but an old",8595
"8596",141,"necklace. You must forgive the liberty, and oblige me.”",8596
"8597",141,"",8597
"8598",141,"Fanny still resisted, and from her heart. The gift was too valuable.",8598
"8599",141,"But Miss Crawford persevered, and argued the case with so much",8599
"8600",141,"affectionate earnestness through all the heads of William and the",8600
"8601",141,"cross, and the ball, and herself, as to be finally successful. Fanny",8601
"8602",141,"found herself obliged to yield, that she might not be accused of pride",8602
"8603",141,"or indifference, or some other littleness; and having with modest",8603
"8604",141,"reluctance given her consent, proceeded to make the selection. She",8604
"8605",141,"looked and looked, longing to know which might be least valuable; and",8605
"8606",141,"was determined in her choice at last, by fancying there was one",8606
"8607",141,"necklace more frequently placed before her eyes than the rest. It was",8607
"8608",141,"of gold, prettily worked; and though Fanny would have preferred a",8608
"8609",141,"longer and a plainer chain as more adapted for her purpose, she hoped,",8609
"8610",141,"in fixing on this, to be chusing what Miss Crawford least wished to",8610
"8611",141,"keep. Miss Crawford smiled her perfect approbation; and hastened to",8611
"8612",141,"complete the gift by putting the necklace round her, and making her see",8612
"8613",141,"how well it looked. Fanny had not a word to say against its",8613
"8614",141,"becomingness, and, excepting what remained of her scruples, was",8614
"8615",141,"exceedingly pleased with an acquisition so very apropos. She would",8615
"8616",141,"rather, perhaps, have been obliged to some other person. But this was",8616
"8617",141,"an unworthy feeling. Miss Crawford had anticipated her wants with a",8617
"8618",141,"kindness which proved her a real friend. “When I wear this necklace I",8618
"8619",141,"shall always think of you,” said she, “and feel how very kind you",8619
"8620",141,"were.”",8620
"8621",141,"",8621
"8622",141,"“You must think of somebody else too, when you wear that necklace,”",8622
"8623",141,"replied Miss Crawford. “You must think of Henry, for it was his choice",8623
"8624",141,"in the first place. He gave it to me, and with the necklace I make over",8624
"8625",141,"to you all the duty of remembering the original giver. It is to be a",8625
"8626",141,"family remembrancer. The sister is not to be in your mind without",8626
"8627",141,"bringing the brother too.”",8627
"8628",141,"",8628
"8629",141,"Fanny, in great astonishment and confusion, would have returned the",8629
"8630",141,"present instantly. To take what had been the gift of another person, of",8630
"8631",141,"a brother too, impossible! it must not be! and with an eagerness and",8631
"8632",141,"embarrassment quite diverting to her companion, she laid down the",8632
"8633",141,"necklace again on its cotton, and seemed resolved either to take",8633
"8634",141,"another or none at all. Miss Crawford thought she had never seen a",8634
"8635",141,"prettier consciousness. “My dear child,” said she, laughing, “what are",8635
"8636",141,"you afraid of? Do you think Henry will claim the necklace as mine, and",8636
"8637",141,"fancy you did not come honestly by it? or are you imagining he would be",8637
"8638",141,"too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which",8638
"8639",141,"his money purchased three years ago, before he knew there was such a",8639
"8640",141,"throat in the world? or perhaps”—looking archly—“you suspect a",8640
"8641",141,"confederacy between us, and that what I am now doing is with his",8641
"8642",141,"knowledge and at his desire?”",8642

"8644",141,"With the deepest blushes Fanny protested against such a thought.",8644
"8645",141,"",8645
"8646",141,"“Well, then,” replied Miss Crawford more seriously, but without at all",8646
"8647",141,"believing her, “to convince me that you suspect no trick, and are as",8647
"8648",141,"unsuspicious of compliment as I have always found you, take the",8648
"8649",141,"necklace and say no more about it. Its being a gift of my brother’s",8649
"8650",141,"need not make the smallest difference in your accepting it, as I assure",8650
"8651",141,"you it makes none in my willingness to part with it. He is always",8651
"8652",141,"giving me something or other. I have such innumerable presents from him",8652
"8653",141,"that it is quite impossible for me to value or for him to remember",8653
"8654",141,"half. And as for this necklace, I do not suppose I have worn it six",8654
"8655",141,"times: it is very pretty, but I never think of it; and though you would",8655
"8656",141,"be most heartily welcome to any other in my trinket-box, you have",8656
"8657",141,"happened to fix on the very one which, if I have a choice, I would",8657
"8658",141,"rather part with and see in your possession than any other. Say no more",8658

"8661",141,"",8661
"8662",141,"Fanny dared not make any farther opposition; and with renewed but less",8662

"8698",141,"business, which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little",8698
"8699",141,"trifle—a chain for William’s cross. You ought to have had it a week",8699
"8700",141,"ago, but there has been a delay from my brother’s not being in town by",8700
"8701",141,"several days so soon as I expected; and I have only just now received",8701
"8702",141,"it at Northampton. I hope you will like the chain itself, Fanny. I",8702
"8703",141,"endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste; but, at any rate,",8703
"8704",141,"I know you will be kind to my intentions, and consider it, as it really",8704

"8743",141,"",8743
"8744",141,"It was about the necklace, which she was now most earnestly longing to",8744

"8751",141,"some time before she could get his attention to her plan, or any answer",8751

"8808",141,"deceived in her: he gave her merits which she had not; her faults were",8808

"8829",141,"not be much wondered at, if, after making all these good resolutions on",8829
"8830",141,"the side of self-government, she seized the scrap of paper on which",8830

"8854",141,"kindness to Fanny than such self-willed, unmanageable days often",8854
"8855",141,"volunteer, for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was brought",8855
"8856",141,"from Mr. Crawford to William, stating that as he found himself obliged",8856
"8857",141,"to go to London on the morrow for a few days, he could not help trying",8857
"8858",141,"to procure a companion; and therefore hoped that if William could make",8858
"8859",141,"up his mind to leave Mansfield half a day earlier than had been",8859
"8860",141,"proposed, he would accept a place in his carriage. Mr. Crawford meant",8860
"8861",141,"to be in town by his uncle’s accustomary late dinner-hour, and William",8861
"8862",141,"was invited to dine with him at the Admiral’s. The proposal was a very",8862
"8863",141,"pleasant one to William himself, who enjoyed the idea of travelling",8863
"8864",141,"post with four horses, and such a good-humoured, agreeable friend; and,",8864
"8865",141,"in likening it to going up with despatches, was saying at once",8865
"8866",141,"everything in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination",8866
"8867",141,"could suggest; and Fanny, from a different motive, was exceedingly",8867
"8868",141,"pleased; for the original plan was that William should go up by the",8868
"8869",141,"mail from Northampton the following night, which would not have allowed",8869
"8870",141,"him an hour’s rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach; and",8870
"8871",141,"though this offer of Mr. Crawford’s would rob her of many hours of his",8871
"8872",141,"company, she was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of",8872
"8873",141,"such a journey, to think of anything else. Sir Thomas approved of it",8873
"8874",141,"for another reason. His nephew’s introduction to Admiral Crawford might",8874
"8875",141,"be of service. The Admiral, he believed, had interest. Upon the whole,",8875
"8876",141,"it was a very joyous note. Fanny’s spirits lived on it half the",8876
"8877",141,"morning, deriving some accession of pleasure from its writer being",8877
"8878",141,"himself to go away.",8878
"8879",141,"",8879
"8880",141,"As for the ball, so near at hand, she had too many agitations and fears",8880
"8881",141,"to have half the enjoyment in anticipation which she ought to have had,",8881
"8882",141,"or must have been supposed to have by the many young ladies looking",8882
"8883",141,"forward to the same event in situations more at ease, but under",8883
"8884",141,"circumstances of less novelty, less interest, less peculiar",8884
"8885",141,"gratification, than would be attributed to her. Miss Price, known only",8885
"8886",141,"by name to half the people invited, was now to make her first",8886
"8887",141,"appearance, and must be regarded as the queen of the evening. Who could",8887
"8888",141,"be happier than Miss Price? But Miss Price had not been brought up to",8888
"8889",141,"the trade of _coming_ _out_; and had she known in what light this ball",8889
"8890",141,"was, in general, considered respecting her, it would very much have",8890
"8891",141,"lessened her comfort by increasing the fears she already had of doing",8891
"8892",141,"wrong and being looked at. To dance without much observation or any",8892
"8893",141,"extraordinary fatigue, to have strength and partners for about half the",8893
"8894",141,"evening, to dance a little with Edmund, and not a great deal with Mr.",8894
"8895",141,"Crawford, to see William enjoy himself, and be able to keep away from",8895
"8896",141,"her aunt Norris, was the height of her ambition, and seemed to",8896
"8897",141,"comprehend her greatest possibility of happiness. As these were the",8897
"8898",141,"best of her hopes, they could not always prevail; and in the course of",8898
"8899",141,"a long morning, spent principally with her two aunts, she was often",8899
"8900",141,"under the influence of much less sanguine views. William, determined to",8900

"8903",141,"left alone to bear the worrying of Mrs. Norris, who was cross because",8903

"9081",141,"was approved; and the consciousness of looking well made her look still",9081
"9082",141,"better. From a variety of causes she was happy, and she was soon made",9082
"9083",141,"still happier; for in following her aunts out of the room, Edmund, who",9083
"9084",141,"was holding open the door, said, as she passed him, “You must dance",9084
"9085",141,"with me, Fanny; you must keep two dances for me; any two that you like,",9085
"9086",141,"except the first.” She had nothing more to wish for. She had hardly",9086

"9097",141,"to think of her conversation with Edmund, and what was the restlessness",9097

"9110",141,"formality of the first great circle, which the manners of neither Sir",9110
"9111",141,"Thomas nor Lady Bertram were of a kind to do away, she found herself",9111
"9112",141,"occasionally called on to endure something worse. She was introduced",9112
"9113",141,"here and there by her uncle, and forced to be spoken to, and to",9113
"9114",141,"curtsey, and speak again. This was a hard duty, and she was never",9114

"9119",141,"stiffness of the meeting soon gave way before their popular manners and",9119
"9120",141,"more diffused intimacies: little groups were formed, and everybody grew",9120
"9121",141,"comfortable. Fanny felt the advantage; and, drawing back from the toils",9121
"9122",141,"of civility, would have been again most happy, could she have kept her",9122
"9123",141,"eyes from wandering between Edmund and Mary Crawford. _She_ looked all",9123
"9124",141,"loveliness—and what might not be the end of it? Her own musings were",9124
"9125",141,"brought to an end on perceiving Mr. Crawford before her, and her",9125
"9126",141,"thoughts were put into another channel by his engaging her almost",9126
"9127",141,"instantly for the first two dances. Her happiness on this occasion was",9127
"9128",141,"very much _à la mortal_, finely chequered. To be secure of a partner at",9128
"9129",141,"first was a most essential good—for the moment of beginning was now",9129
"9130",141,"growing seriously near; and she so little understood her own claims as",9130
"9131",141,"to think that if Mr. Crawford had not asked her, she must have been the",9131
"9132",141,"last to be sought after, and should have received a partner only",9132
"9133",141,"through a series of inquiry, and bustle, and interference, which would",9133
"9134",141,"have been terrible; but at the same time there was a pointedness in his",9134
"9135",141,"manner of asking her which she did not like, and she saw his eye",9135
"9136",141,"glancing for a moment at her necklace, with a smile—she thought there",9136
"9137",141,"was a smile—which made her blush and feel wretched. And though there",9137

"9147",141,"immediately and more unequivocally directed as her brother’s had been,",9147

"9149",141,"get the story over, hastened to give the explanation of the second",9149
"9150",141,"necklace: the real chain. Miss Crawford listened; and all her intended",9150

"9161",141,"Miss Crawford’s feelings. They were in the ballroom, the violins were",9161
"9162",141,"playing, and her mind was in a flutter that forbade its fixing on",9162

"9174",141,"she could not help an exclamation of surprise, a hint of her unfitness,",9174
"9175",141,"an entreaty even to be excused. To be urging her opinion against Sir",9175
"9176",141,"Thomas’s was a proof of the extremity of the case; but such was her",9176

"9244",141,"town to-morrow? He says he has business there, but will not tell me",9244
"9245",141,"what. The first time he ever denied me his confidence! But this is what",9245

"9262",141,"previous inquiries of Mrs. Norris, about the supper hour, were all for",9262
"9263",141,"the sake of securing her at that part of the evening. But it was not to",9263
"9264",141,"be avoided: he made her feel that she was the object of all; though she",9264
"9265",141,"could not say that it was unpleasantly done, that there was indelicacy",9265
"9266",141,"or ostentation in his manner; and sometimes, when he talked of William,",9266
"9267",141,"he was really not unagreeable, and shewed even a warmth of heart which",9267
"9268",141,"did him credit. But still his attentions made no part of her",9268
"9269",141,"satisfaction. She was happy whenever she looked at William, and saw how",9269
"9270",141,"perfectly he was enjoying himself, in every five minutes that she could",9270
"9271",141,"walk about with him and hear his account of his partners; she was happy",9271

"9278",141,"His mind was fagged, and her happiness sprung from being the friend",9278

"9298",141,"satisfied. It was barbarous to be happy when Edmund was suffering. Yet",9298

"9402",141,"and then all were gone. Nothing remained of last night but",9402
"9403",141,"remembrances, which she had nobody to share in. She talked to her aunt",9403
"9404",141,"Bertram—she must talk to somebody of the ball; but her aunt had seen so",9404
"9405",141,"little of what had passed, and had so little curiosity, that it was",9405
"9406",141,"heavy work. Lady Bertram was not certain of anybody’s dress or",9406
"9407",141,"anybody’s place at supper but her own. “She could not recollect what it",9407
"9408",141,"was that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes, or what it was",9408
"9409",141,"that Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny: she was not sure whether",9409
"9410",141,"Colonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he",9410

"9413",141,"And these were her longest speeches and clearest communications: the",9413
"9414",141,"rest was only a languid “Yes, yes; very well; did you? did he? I did",9414
"9415",141,"not see _that_; I should not know one from the other.” This was very",9415
"9416",141,"bad. It was only better than Mrs. Norris’s sharp answers would have",9416
"9417",141,"been; but she being gone home with all the supernumerary jellies to",9417

"9515",141,"brother’s going away, of William Price’s going too, and completing the",9515
"9516",141,"sort of general break-up of a party which had been so animated. She",9516

"9520",141,"acting on them in defiance of her (and she had been so angry that they",9520

"9666",141,"",9666
"9667",141,"Miss Crawford’s uneasiness was much lightened by this conversation, and",9667
"9668",141,"she walked home again in spirits which might have defied almost another",9668
"9669",141,"week of the same small party in the same bad weather, had they been put",9669

"9671",141,"London again in quite, or more than quite, his usual cheerfulness, she",9671
"9672",141,"had nothing farther to try her own. His still refusing to tell her what",9672
"9673",141,"he had gone for was but the promotion of gaiety; a day before it might",9673
"9674",141,"have irritated, but now it was a pleasant joke—suspected only of",9674
"9675",141,"concealing something planned as a pleasant surprise to herself. And the",9675
"9676",141,"next day _did_ bring a surprise to her. Henry had said he should just",9676
"9677",141,"go and ask the Bertrams how they did, and be back in ten minutes, but",9677
"9678",141,"he was gone above an hour; and when his sister, who had been waiting",9678
"9679",141,"for him to walk with her in the garden, met him at last most",9679
"9680",141,"impatiently in the sweep, and cried out, “My dear Henry, where can you",9680
"9681",141,"have been all this time?” he had only to say that he had been sitting",9681

"9688",141,"“Yes, Mary,” said he, drawing her arm within his, and walking along the",9688

"9697",141,"astonishment she felt, that he was obliged to repeat what he had said,",9697
"9698",141,"and more fully and more solemnly. The conviction of his determination",9698
"9699",141,"once admitted, it was not unwelcome. There was even pleasure with the",9699

"9920",141,"together in the breakfast-room, and, fortunately for him, Lady Bertram",9920

"10284",141,"Mansfield on purpose to do. And why it was not done already she could",10284
"10285",141,"not devise, for Miss Crawford certainly wanted no delay. Fanny had",10285
"10286",141,"hoped, in the course of his yesterday’s visit, to hear the day named;",10286
"10287",141,"but he had only spoken of their journey as what would take place ere",10287

"10290",141,"Having so satisfactorily settled the conviction her note would convey,",10290

"10292",141,"accidentally did, coming up to the house again, and at an hour as early",10292
"10293",141,"as the day before. His coming might have nothing to do with her, but",10293
"10294",141,"she must avoid seeing him if possible; and being then on her way",10294
"10295",141,"upstairs, she resolved there to remain, during the whole of his visit,",10295
"10296",141,"unless actually sent for; and as Mrs. Norris was still in the house,",10296

"10302",141,"to employ herself, and able to hope that Mr. Crawford had come and",10302

"10305",141,"Nearly half an hour had passed, and she was growing very comfortable,",10305
"10306",141,"when suddenly the sound of a step in regular approach was heard; a",10306
"10307",141,"heavy step, an unusual step in that part of the house: it was her",10307
"10308",141,"uncle’s; she knew it as well as his voice; she had trembled at it as",10308
"10309",141,"often, and began to tremble again, at the idea of his coming up to",10309
"10310",141,"speak to her, whatever might be the subject. It was indeed Sir Thomas",10310
"10311",141,"who opened the door and asked if she were there, and if he might come",10311
"10312",141,"in. The terror of his former occasional visits to that room seemed all",10312
"10313",141,"renewed, and she felt as if he were going to examine her again in",10313
"10314",141,"French and English.",10314

"10333",141,"misapprehension which must be rectified. It is highly unfit for you to",10333

"10343",141,"advocate, and very judiciously, for young people’s being brought up",10343
"10344",141,"without unnecessary indulgences; but there should be moderation in",10344
"10345",141,"everything. She is also very hardy herself, which of course will",10345
"10346",141,"influence her in her opinion of the wants of others. And on another",10346
"10347",141,"account, too, I can perfectly comprehend. I know what her sentiments",10347
"10348",141,"have always been. The principle was good in itself, but it may have",10348
"10349",141,"been, and I believe _has_ _been_, carried too far in your case. I am",10349
"10350",141,"aware that there has been sometimes, in some points, a misplaced",10350
"10351",141,"distinction; but I think too well of you, Fanny, to suppose you will",10351
"10352",141,"ever harbour resentment on that account. You have an understanding",10352
"10353",141,"which will prevent you from receiving things only in part, and judging",10353
"10354",141,"partially by the event. You will take in the whole of the past, you",10354
"10355",141,"will consider times, persons, and probabilities, and you will feel that",10355
"10356",141,"_they_ were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you",10356
"10357",141,"for that mediocrity of condition which _seemed_ to be your lot. Though",10357
"10358",141,"their caution may prove eventually unnecessary, it was kindly meant;",10358
"10359",141,"and of this you may be assured, that every advantage of affluence will",10359
"10360",141,"be doubled by the little privations and restrictions that may have been",10360
"10361",141,"imposed. I am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you, by",10361
"10362",141,"failing at any time to treat your aunt Norris with the respect and",10362
"10363",141,"attention that are due to her. But enough of this. Sit down, my dear. I",10363

"10382",141,"feeling, moreover, his own replies, and his own remarks to have been",10382
"10383",141,"very much to the purpose, was exceedingly happy to give the particulars",10383
"10384",141,"of their conversation; and little aware of what was passing in his",10384
"10385",141,"niece’s mind, conceived that by such details he must be gratifying her",10385
"10386",141,"far more than himself. He talked, therefore, for several minutes",10386
"10387",141,"without Fanny’s daring to interrupt him. She had hardly even attained",10387
"10388",141,"the wish to do it. Her mind was in too much confusion. She had changed",10388
"10389",141,"her position; and, with her eyes fixed intently on one of the windows,",10389
"10390",141,"was listening to her uncle in the utmost perturbation and dismay. For a",10390
"10391",141,"moment he ceased, but she had barely become conscious of it, when,",10391
"10392",141,"rising from his chair, he said, “And now, Fanny, having performed one",10392
"10393",141,"part of my commission, and shewn you everything placed on a basis the",10393
"10394",141,"most assured and satisfactory, I may execute the remainder by",10394
"10395",141,"prevailing on you to accompany me downstairs, where, though I cannot",10395
"10396",141,"but presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself, I must",10396
"10397",141,"submit to your finding one still better worth listening to. Mr.",10397
"10398",141,"Crawford, as you have perhaps foreseen, is yet in the house. He is in",10398
"10399",141,"my room, and hoping to see you there.”",10399
"10400",141,"",10400
"10401",141,"There was a look, a start, an exclamation on hearing this, which",10401
"10402",141,"astonished Sir Thomas; but what was his increase of astonishment on",10402
"10403",141,"hearing her exclaim—“Oh! no, sir, I cannot, indeed I cannot go down to",10403
"10404",141,"him. Mr. Crawford ought to know—he must know that: I told him enough",10404
"10405",141,"yesterday to convince him; he spoke to me on this subject yesterday,",10405
"10406",141,"and I told him without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me,",10406

"10413",141,"permit herself to give. I was very much pleased with what I collected",10413
"10414",141,"to have been your behaviour on the occasion; it shewed a discretion",10414
"10415",141,"highly to be commended. But now, when he has made his overtures so",10415

"10419",141,"moment even to tell her uncle that he was wrong; “you are quite",10419
"10420",141,"mistaken. How could Mr. Crawford say such a thing? I gave him no",10420
"10421",141,"encouragement yesterday. On the contrary, I told him, I cannot",10421
"10422",141,"recollect my exact words, but I am sure I told him that I would not",10422
"10423",141,"listen to him, that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect, and",10423
"10424",141,"that I begged him never to talk to me in that manner again. I am sure I",10424

"10447",141,"not reach. Here is a young man wishing to pay his addresses to you,",10447
"10448",141,"with everything to recommend him: not merely situation in life,",10448
"10449",141,"fortune, and character, but with more than common agreeableness, with",10449
"10450",141,"address and conversation pleasing to everybody. And he is not an",10450
"10451",141,"acquaintance of to-day; you have now known him some time. His sister,",10451
"10452",141,"moreover, is your intimate friend, and he has been doing _that_ for",10452
"10453",141,"your brother, which I should suppose would have been almost sufficient",10453
"10454",141,"recommendation to you, had there been no other. It is very uncertain",10454

"10465",141,"have no accusation to make on that head), I never perceived them to be",10465
"10466",141,"unpleasant to you. I am half inclined to think, Fanny, that you do not",10466

"10472",141,"Sir Thomas looked at her with deeper surprise. “This is beyond me,”",10472

"10476",141,"He paused and eyed her fixedly. He saw her lips formed into a _no_,",10476

"10478",141,"however, in so modest a girl, might be very compatible with innocence;",10478

"10483",141,"And for a few minutes he did say nothing. He was deep in thought. His",10483
"10484",141,"niece was deep in thought likewise, trying to harden and prepare",10484
"10485",141,"herself against farther questioning. She would rather die than own the",10485
"10486",141,"truth; and she hoped, by a little reflection, to fortify herself beyond",10486

"10491",141,"wishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me. I am an",10491
"10492",141,"advocate for early marriages, where there are means in proportion, and",10492
"10493",141,"would have every young man, with a sufficient income, settle as soon",10493
"10494",141,"after four-and-twenty as he can. This is so much my opinion, that I am",10494
"10495",141,"sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son, your cousin, Mr.",10495
"10496",141,"Bertram, is to marry early; but at present, as far as I can judge,",10496
"10497",141,"matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts. I wish he were more",10497
"10498",141,"likely to fix.” Here was a glance at Fanny. “Edmund, I consider, from",10498
"10499",141,"his dispositions and habits, as much more likely to marry early than",10499
"10500",141,"his brother. _He_, indeed, I have lately thought, has seen the woman he",10500
"10501",141,"could love, which, I am convinced, my eldest son has not. Am I right?",10501

"10506",141,"It was gently, but it was calmly said, and Sir Thomas was easy on the",10506

"10509",141,"increased; and getting up and walking about the room with a frown,",10509

"10519",141,"observations, which, for her cousins’ sake, she could scarcely dare",10519
"10520",141,"mention to their father. Maria and Julia, and especially Maria, were so",10520

"10524",141,"honourable, so good, the simple acknowledgment of settled _dislike_ on",10524

"10536",141,"shewn, formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my",10536
"10537",141,"return to England. I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of",10537
"10538",141,"temper, self-conceit, and every tendency to that independence of spirit",10538
"10539",141,"which prevails so much in modern days, even in young women, and which",10539
"10540",141,"in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence.",10540
"10541",141,"But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse; that you",10541
"10542",141,"can and will decide for yourself, without any consideration or",10542
"10543",141,"deference for those who have surely some right to guide you, without",10543
"10544",141,"even asking their advice. You have shewn yourself very, very different",10544
"10545",141,"from anything that I had imagined. The advantage or disadvantage of",10545
"10546",141,"your family, of your parents, your brothers and sisters, never seems to",10546
"10547",141,"have had a moment’s share in your thoughts on this occasion. How _they_",10547
"10548",141,"might be benefited, how _they_ must rejoice in such an establishment",10548
"10549",141,"for you, is nothing to _you_. You think only of yourself, and because",10549
"10550",141,"you do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy",10550
"10551",141,"imagines to be necessary for happiness, you resolve to refuse him at",10551
"10552",141,"once, without wishing even for a little time to consider of it, a",10552
"10553",141,"little more time for cool consideration, and for really examining your",10553
"10554",141,"own inclinations; and are, in a wild fit of folly, throwing away from",10554
"10555",141,"you such an opportunity of being settled in life, eligibly, honourably,",10555
"10556",141,"nobly settled, as will, probably, never occur to you again. Here is a",10556
"10557",141,"young man of sense, of character, of temper, of manners, and of",10557
"10558",141,"fortune, exceedingly attached to you, and seeking your hand in the most",10558
"10559",141,"handsome and disinterested way; and let me tell you, Fanny, that you",10559
"10560",141,"may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by",10560
"10561",141,"a man of half Mr. Crawford’s estate, or a tenth part of his merits.",10561
"10562",141,"Gladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters on him. Maria",10562
"10563",141,"is nobly married; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia’s hand, I should",10563
"10564",141,"have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than",10564
"10565",141,"I gave Maria’s to Mr. Rushworth.” After half a moment’s pause: “And I",10565
"10566",141,"should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters, on",10566
"10567",141,"receiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it",10567
"10568",141,"only _half_ the eligibility of _this_, immediately and peremptorily,",10568
"10569",141,"and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any",10569
"10570",141,"consultation, put a decided negative on it. I should have been much",10570
"10571",141,"surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding. I should have thought it",10571
"10572",141,"a gross violation of duty and respect. _You_ are not to be judged by",10572
"10573",141,"the same rule. You do not owe me the duty of a child. But, Fanny, if",10573
"10574",141,"your heart can acquit you of _ingratitude_—”",10574
"10575",141,"",10575
"10576",141,"He ceased. Fanny was by this time crying so bitterly that, angry as he",10576
"10577",141,"was, he would not press that article farther. Her heart was almost",10577
"10578",141,"broke by such a picture of what she appeared to him; by such",10578
"10579",141,"accusations, so heavy, so multiplied, so rising in dreadful gradation!",10579
"10580",141,"Self-willed, obstinate, selfish, and ungrateful. He thought her all",10580
"10581",141,"this. She had deceived his expectations; she had lost his good opinion.",10581
"10582",141,"What was to become of her?",10582
"10583",141,"",10583
"10584",141,"“I am very sorry,” said she inarticulately, through her tears, “I am",10584

"10586",141,"",10586
"10587",141,"“Sorry! yes, I hope you are sorry; and you will probably have reason to",10587

"10593",141,"",10593
"10594",141,"Another burst of tears; but in spite of that burst, and in spite of",10594
"10595",141,"that great black word _miserable_, which served to introduce it, Sir",10595
"10596",141,"Thomas began to think a little relenting, a little change of",10596
"10597",141,"inclination, might have something to do with it; and to augur",10597
"10598",141,"favourably from the personal entreaty of the young man himself. He knew",10598
"10599",141,"her to be very timid, and exceedingly nervous; and thought it not",10599
"10600",141,"improbable that her mind might be in such a state as a little time, a",10600
"10601",141,"little pressing, a little patience, and a little impatience, a",10601
"10602",141,"judicious mixture of all on the lover’s side, might work their usual",10602
"10603",141,"effect on. If the gentleman would but persevere, if he had but love",10603
"10604",141,"enough to persevere, Sir Thomas began to have hopes; and these",10604
"10605",141,"reflections having passed across his mind and cheered it, “Well,” said",10605
"10606",141,"he, in a tone of becoming gravity, but of less anger, “well, child, dry",10606
"10607",141,"up your tears. There is no use in these tears; they can do no good. You",10607
"10608",141,"must now come downstairs with me. Mr. Crawford has been kept waiting",10608
"10609",141,"too long already. You must give him your own answer: we cannot expect",10609
"10610",141,"him to be satisfied with less; and you only can explain to him the",10610
"10611",141,"grounds of that misconception of your sentiments, which, unfortunately",10611
"10612",141,"for himself, he certainly has imbibed. I am totally unequal to it.”",10612
"10613",141,"",10613
"10614",141,"But Fanny shewed such reluctance, such misery, at the idea of going",10614
"10615",141,"down to him, that Sir Thomas, after a little consideration, judged it",10615
"10616",141,"better to indulge her. His hopes from both gentleman and lady suffered",10616
"10617",141,"a small depression in consequence; but when he looked at his niece, and",10617
"10618",141,"saw the state of feature and complexion which her crying had brought",10618
"10619",141,"her into, he thought there might be as much lost as gained by an",10619
"10620",141,"immediate interview. With a few words, therefore, of no particular",10620
"10621",141,"meaning, he walked off by himself, leaving his poor niece to sit and",10621
"10622",141,"cry over what had passed, with very wretched feelings.",10622
"10623",141,"",10623
"10624",141,"Her mind was all disorder. The past, present, future, everything was",10624
"10625",141,"terrible. But her uncle’s anger gave her the severest pain of all.",10625
"10626",141,"Selfish and ungrateful! to have appeared so to him! She was miserable",10626
"10627",141,"for ever. She had no one to take her part, to counsel, or speak for",10627
"10628",141,"her. Her only friend was absent. He might have softened his father; but",10628
"10629",141,"all, perhaps all, would think her selfish and ungrateful. She might",10629
"10630",141,"have to endure the reproach again and again; she might hear it, or see",10630
"10631",141,"it, or know it to exist for ever in every connexion about her. She",10631
"10632",141,"could not but feel some resentment against Mr. Crawford; yet, if he",10632
"10633",141,"really loved her, and were unhappy too! It was all wretchedness",10633

"10635",141,"",10635
"10636",141,"In about a quarter of an hour her uncle returned; she was almost ready",10636
"10637",141,"to faint at the sight of him. He spoke calmly, however, without",10637
"10638",141,"austerity, without reproach, and she revived a little. There was",10638
"10639",141,"comfort, too, in his words, as well as his manner, for he began with,",10639
"10640",141,"“Mr. Crawford is gone: he has just left me. I need not repeat what has",10640
"10641",141,"passed. I do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling, by an",10641
"10642",141,"account of what he has felt. Suffice it, that he has behaved in the",10642
"10643",141,"most gentlemanlike and generous manner, and has confirmed me in a most",10643
"10644",141,"favourable opinion of his understanding, heart, and temper. Upon my",10644
"10645",141,"representation of what you were suffering, he immediately, and with the",10645

"10650",141,"to speak with you alone, be it only for five minutes; a request too",10650
"10651",141,"natural, a claim too just to be denied. But there is no time fixed;",10651
"10652",141,"perhaps to-morrow, or whenever your spirits are composed enough. For",10652
"10653",141,"the present you have only to tranquillise yourself. Check these tears;",10653
"10654",141,"they do but exhaust you. If, as I am willing to suppose, you wish to",10654
"10655",141,"shew me any observance, you will not give way to these emotions, but",10655
"10656",141,"endeavour to reason yourself into a stronger frame of mind. I advise",10656
"10657",141,"you to go out: the air will do you good; go out for an hour on the",10657
"10658",141,"gravel; you will have the shrubbery to yourself, and will be the better",10658
"10659",141,"for air and exercise. And, Fanny” (turning back again for a moment), “I",10659
"10660",141,"shall make no mention below of what has passed; I shall not even tell",10660
"10661",141,"your aunt Bertram. There is no occasion for spreading the",10661

"10666",141,"Norris’s interminable reproaches! he left her in a glow of gratitude.",10666
"10667",141,"Anything might be bearable rather than such reproaches. Even to see Mr.",10667
"10668",141,"Crawford would be less overpowering.",10668
"10669",141,"",10669
"10670",141,"She walked out directly, as her uncle recommended, and followed his",10670
"10671",141,"advice throughout, as far as she could; did check her tears; did",10671
"10672",141,"earnestly try to compose her spirits and strengthen her mind. She",10672
"10673",141,"wished to prove to him that she did desire his comfort, and sought to",10673

"10676",141,"Not to excite suspicion by her look or manner was now an object worth",10676

"10679",141,"",10679
"10680",141,"She was struck, quite struck, when, on returning from her walk and",10680
"10681",141,"going into the East room again, the first thing which caught her eye",10681
"10682",141,"was a fire lighted and burning. A fire! it seemed too much; just at",10682
"10683",141,"that time to be giving her such an indulgence was exciting even painful",10683
"10684",141,"gratitude. She wondered that Sir Thomas could have leisure to think of",10684
"10685",141,"such a trifle again; but she soon found, from the voluntary information",10685
"10686",141,"of the housemaid, who came in to attend it, that so it was to be every",10686
"10687",141,"day. Sir Thomas had given orders for it.",10687
"10688",141,"",10688
"10689",141,"“I must be a brute, indeed, if I can be really ungrateful!” said she,",10689

"10692",141,"She saw nothing more of her uncle, nor of her aunt Norris, till they",10692
"10693",141,"met at dinner. Her uncle’s behaviour to her was then as nearly as",10693
"10694",141,"possible what it had been before; she was sure he did not mean there",10694
"10695",141,"should be any change, and that it was only her own conscience that",10695
"10696",141,"could fancy any; but her aunt was soon quarrelling with her; and when",10696
"10697",141,"she found how much and how unpleasantly her having only walked out",10697
"10698",141,"without her aunt’s knowledge could be dwelt on, she felt all the reason",10698
"10699",141,"she had to bless the kindness which saved her from the same spirit of",10699

"10715",141,"Fanny would have had quite as good a walk there, I assure you, with the",10715
"10716",141,"advantage of being of some use, and obliging her aunt: it is all her",10716
"10717",141,"fault. If she would but have let us know she was going out but there is",10717
"10718",141,"a something about Fanny, I have often observed it before—she likes to",10718
"10719",141,"go her own way to work; she does not like to be dictated to; she takes",10719
"10720",141,"her own independent walk whenever she can; she certainly has a little",10720

"10728",141,"enough to perceive, either now, or at any other time, to what degree he",10728
"10729",141,"thought well of his niece, or how very far he was from wishing to have",10729

"10738",141,"For the purity of her intentions she could answer; and she was willing",10738

"10741",141,"felt, as a good man must feel, how wretched, and how unpardonable, how",10741

"10744",141,"When the meeting with which she was threatened for the morrow was past,",10744

"10747",141,"would soon be as if no such subject had existed. She would not, could",10747
"10748",141,"not believe, that Mr. Crawford’s affection for her could distress him",10748

"10786",141,"which strongly inclined him in the first place to think she did love",10786

"10788",141,"constrained at last to admit that she did know her own present",10788

"10798",141,"He would not despair: he would not desist. He had every well-grounded",10798

"10800",141,"could justify the warmest hopes of lasting happiness with her; her",10800

"10805",141,"_that_ he had no suspicion. He considered her rather as one who had",10805
"10806",141,"never thought on the subject enough to be in danger; who had been",10806
"10807",141,"guarded by youth, a youth of mind as lovely as of person; whose modesty",10807
"10808",141,"had prevented her from understanding his attentions, and who was still",10808
"10809",141,"overpowered by the suddenness of addresses so wholly unexpected, and",10809
"10810",141,"the novelty of a situation which her fancy had never taken into",10810
"10811",141,"account.",10811

"10813",141,"Must it not follow of course, that, when he was understood, he should",10813
"10814",141,"succeed? He believed it fully. Love such as his, in a man like himself,",10814
"10815",141,"must with perseverance secure a return, and at no great distance; and",10815
"10816",141,"he had so much delight in the idea of obliging her to love him in a",10816
"10817",141,"very short time, that her not loving him now was scarcely regretted. A",10817
"10818",141,"little difficulty to be overcome was no evil to Henry Crawford. He",10818
"10819",141,"rather derived spirits from it. He had been apt to gain hearts too",10819

"10822",141,"To Fanny, however, who had known too much opposition all her life to",10822
"10823",141,"find any charm in it, all this was unintelligible. She found that he",10823
"10824",141,"did mean to persevere; but how he could, after such language from her",10824
"10825",141,"as she felt herself obliged to use, was not to be understood. She told",10825
"10826",141,"him that she did not love him, could not love him, was sure she never",10826
"10827",141,"should love him; that such a change was quite impossible; that the",10827
"10828",141,"subject was most painful to her; that she must entreat him never to",10828
"10829",141,"mention it again, to allow her to leave him at once, and let it be",10829
"10830",141,"considered as concluded for ever. And when farther pressed, had added,",10830
"10831",141,"that in her opinion their dispositions were so totally dissimilar as to",10831
"10832",141,"make mutual affection incompatible; and that they were unfitted for",10832
"10833",141,"each other by nature, education, and habit. All this she had said, and",10833
"10834",141,"with the earnestness of sincerity; yet this was not enough, for he",10834
"10835",141,"immediately denied there being anything uncongenial in their",10835
"10836",141,"characters, or anything unfriendly in their situations; and positively",10836
"10837",141,"declared, that he would still love, and still hope!",10837
"10838",141,"",10838
"10839",141,"Fanny knew her own meaning, but was no judge of her own manner. Her",10839
"10840",141,"manner was incurably gentle; and she was not aware how much it",10840
"10841",141,"concealed the sternness of her purpose. Her diffidence, gratitude, and",10841
"10842",141,"softness made every expression of indifference seem almost an effort of",10842
"10843",141,"self-denial; seem, at least, to be giving nearly as much pain to",10843
"10844",141,"herself as to him. Mr. Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who, as",10844
"10845",141,"the clandestine, insidious, treacherous admirer of Maria Bertram, had",10845
"10846",141,"been her abhorrence, whom she had hated to see or to speak to, in whom",10846
"10847",141,"she could believe no good quality to exist, and whose power, even of",10847
"10848",141,"being agreeable, she had barely acknowledged. He was now the Mr.",10848
"10849",141,"Crawford who was addressing herself with ardent, disinterested love;",10849
"10850",141,"whose feelings were apparently become all that was honourable and",10850
"10851",141,"upright, whose views of happiness were all fixed on a marriage of",10851
"10852",141,"attachment; who was pouring out his sense of her merits, describing and",10852
"10853",141,"describing again his affection, proving as far as words could prove it,",10853
"10854",141,"and in the language, tone, and spirit of a man of talent too, that he",10854
"10855",141,"sought her for her gentleness and her goodness; and to complete the",10855
"10856",141,"whole, he was now the Mr. Crawford who had procured William’s",10856
"10857",141,"promotion!",10857
"10858",141,"",10858
"10859",141,"Here was a change, and here were claims which could not but operate!",10859
"10860",141,"She might have disdained him in all the dignity of angry virtue, in the",10860
"10861",141,"grounds of Sotherton, or the theatre at Mansfield Park; but he",10861
"10862",141,"approached her now with rights that demanded different treatment. She",10862
"10863",141,"must be courteous, and she must be compassionate. She must have a",10863
"10864",141,"sensation of being honoured, and whether thinking of herself or her",10864
"10865",141,"brother, she must have a strong feeling of gratitude. The effect of the",10865
"10866",141,"whole was a manner so pitying and agitated, and words intermingled with",10866
"10867",141,"her refusal so expressive of obligation and concern, that to a temper",10867
"10868",141,"of vanity and hope like Crawford’s, the truth, or at least the strength",10868
"10869",141,"of her indifference, might well be questionable; and he was not so",10869
"10870",141,"irrational as Fanny considered him, in the professions of persevering,",10870
"10871",141,"assiduous, and not desponding attachment which closed the interview.",10871
"10872",141,"",10872
"10873",141,"It was with reluctance that he suffered her to go; but there was no",10873
"10874",141,"look of despair in parting to belie his words, or give her hopes of his",10874
"10875",141,"being less unreasonable than he professed himself.",10875
"10876",141,"",10876
"10877",141,"Now she was angry. Some resentment did arise at a perseverance so",10877
"10878",141,"selfish and ungenerous. Here was again a want of delicacy and regard",10878
"10879",141,"for others which had formerly so struck and disgusted her. Here was",10879
"10880",141,"again a something of the same Mr. Crawford whom she had so reprobated",10880
"10881",141,"before. How evidently was there a gross want of feeling and humanity",10881
"10882",141,"where his own pleasure was concerned—And, alas! how always known no",10882
"10883",141,"principle to supply as a duty what the heart was deficient in. Had her",10883
"10884",141,"own affections been as free—as perhaps they ought to have been—he never",10884
"10885",141,"could have engaged them.",10885
"10886",141,"",10886
"10887",141,"So thought Fanny, in good truth and sober sadness, as she sat musing",10887
"10888",141,"over that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs: wondering",10888
"10889",141,"at the past and present; wondering at what was yet to come, and in a",10889
"10890",141,"nervous agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion of",10890
"10891",141,"her being never under any circumstances able to love Mr. Crawford, and",10891
"10892",141,"the felicity of having a fire to sit over and think of it.",10892
"10893",141,"",10893
"10894",141,"Sir Thomas was obliged, or obliged himself, to wait till the morrow for",10894
"10895",141,"a knowledge of what had passed between the young people. He then saw",10895
"10896",141,"Mr. Crawford, and received his account. The first feeling was",10896
"10897",141,"disappointment: he had hoped better things; he had thought that an",10897
"10898",141,"hour’s entreaty from a young man like Crawford could not have worked so",10898
"10899",141,"little change on a gentle-tempered girl like Fanny; but there was",10899
"10900",141,"speedy comfort in the determined views and sanguine perseverance of the",10900
"10901",141,"lover; and when seeing such confidence of success in the principal, Sir",10901
"10902",141,"Thomas was soon able to depend on it himself.",10902
"10903",141,"",10903
"10904",141,"Nothing was omitted, on his side, of civility, compliment, or kindness,",10904
"10905",141,"that might assist the plan. Mr. Crawford’s steadiness was honoured, and",10905
"10906",141,"Fanny was praised, and the connexion was still the most desirable in",10906
"10907",141,"the world. At Mansfield Park Mr. Crawford would always be welcome; he",10907
"10908",141,"had only to consult his own judgment and feelings as to the frequency",10908
"10909",141,"of his visits, at present or in future. In all his niece’s family and",10909
"10910",141,"friends, there could be but one opinion, one wish on the subject; the",10910
"10911",141,"influence of all who loved her must incline one way.",10911
"10912",141,"",10912
"10913",141,"Everything was said that could encourage, every encouragement received",10913
"10914",141,"with grateful joy, and the gentlemen parted the best of friends.",10914
"10915",141,"",10915
"10916",141,"Satisfied that the cause was now on a footing the most proper and",10916
"10917",141,"hopeful, Sir Thomas resolved to abstain from all farther importunity",10917
"10918",141,"with his niece, and to shew no open interference. Upon her disposition",10918
"10919",141,"he believed kindness might be the best way of working. Entreaty should",10919
"10920",141,"be from one quarter only. The forbearance of her family on a point,",10920
"10921",141,"respecting which she could be in no doubt of their wishes, might be",10921
"10922",141,"their surest means of forwarding it. Accordingly, on this principle,",10922
"10923",141,"Sir Thomas took the first opportunity of saying to her, with a mild",10923
"10924",141,"gravity, intended to be overcoming, “Well, Fanny, I have seen Mr.",10924
"10925",141,"Crawford again, and learn from him exactly how matters stand between",10925
"10926",141,"you. He is a most extraordinary young man, and whatever be the event,",10926
"10927",141,"you must feel that you have created an attachment of no common",10927
"10928",141,"character; though, young as you are, and little acquainted with the",10928
"10929",141,"transient, varying, unsteady nature of love, as it generally exists,",10929
"10930",141,"you cannot be struck as I am with all that is wonderful in a",10930
"10931",141,"perseverance of this sort against discouragement. With him it is",10931
"10932",141,"entirely a matter of feeling: he claims no merit in it; perhaps is",10932
"10933",141,"entitled to none. Yet, having chosen so well, his constancy has a",10933
"10934",141,"respectable stamp. Had his choice been less unexceptionable, I should",10934
"10935",141,"have condemned his persevering.”",10935
"10936",141,"",10936
"10937",141,"“Indeed, sir,” said Fanny, “I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should",10937
"10938",141,"continue to—I know that it is paying me a very great compliment, and I",10938
"10939",141,"feel most undeservedly honoured; but I am so perfectly convinced, and I",10939
"10940",141,"have told him so, that it never will be in my power—”",10940
"10941",141,"",10941
"10942",141,"“My dear,” interrupted Sir Thomas, “there is no occasion for this. Your",10942
"10943",141,"feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to",10943
"10944",141,"you. There is nothing more to be said or done. From this hour the",10944
"10945",141,"subject is never to be revived between us. You will have nothing to",10945
"10946",141,"fear, or to be agitated about. You cannot suppose me capable of trying",10946
"10947",141,"to persuade you to marry against your inclinations. Your happiness and",10947
"10948",141,"advantage are all that I have in view, and nothing is required of you",10948
"10949",141,"but to bear with Mr. Crawford’s endeavours to convince you that they",10949
"10950",141,"may not be incompatible with his. He proceeds at his own risk. You are",10950
"10951",141,"on safe ground. I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls,",10951
"10952",141,"as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred. You will see",10952
"10953",141,"him with the rest of us, in the same manner, and, as much as you can,",10953
"10954",141,"dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant. He leaves",10954
"10955",141,"Northamptonshire so soon, that even this slight sacrifice cannot be",10955
"10956",141,"often demanded. The future must be very uncertain. And now, my dear",10956
"10957",141,"Fanny, this subject is closed between us.”",10957
"10958",141,"",10958
"10959",141,"The promised departure was all that Fanny could think of with much",10959
"10960",141,"satisfaction. Her uncle’s kind expressions, however, and forbearing",10960
"10961",141,"manner, were sensibly felt; and when she considered how much of the",10961
"10962",141,"truth was unknown to him, she believed she had no right to wonder at",10962
"10963",141,"the line of conduct he pursued. He, who had married a daughter to Mr.",10963
"10964",141,"Rushworth: romantic delicacy was certainly not to be expected from him.",10964
"10965",141,"She must do her duty, and trust that time might make her duty easier",10965
"10966",141,"than it now was.",10966
"10967",141,"",10967
"10968",141,"She could not, though only eighteen, suppose Mr. Crawford’s attachment",10968
"10969",141,"would hold out for ever; she could not but imagine that steady,",10969
"10970",141,"unceasing discouragement from herself would put an end to it in time.",10970
"10971",141,"How much time she might, in her own fancy, allot for its dominion, is",10971
"10972",141,"another concern. It would not be fair to inquire into a young lady’s",10972
"10973",141,"exact estimate of her own perfections.",10973
"10974",141,"",10974
"10975",141,"In spite of his intended silence, Sir Thomas found himself once more",10975
"10976",141,"obliged to mention the subject to his niece, to prepare her briefly for",10976
"10977",141,"its being imparted to her aunts; a measure which he would still have",10977
"10978",141,"avoided, if possible, but which became necessary from the totally",10978
"10979",141,"opposite feelings of Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding. He",10979
"10980",141,"had no idea of concealment. It was all known at the Parsonage, where he",10980
"10981",141,"loved to talk over the future with both his sisters, and it would be",10981
"10982",141,"rather gratifying to him to have enlightened witnesses of the progress",10982
"10983",141,"of his success. When Sir Thomas understood this, he felt the necessity",10983
"10984",141,"of making his own wife and sister-in-law acquainted with the business",10984
"10985",141,"without delay; though, on Fanny’s account, he almost dreaded the effect",10985
"10986",141,"of the communication to Mrs. Norris as much as Fanny herself. He",10986
"10987",141,"deprecated her mistaken but well-meaning zeal. Sir Thomas, indeed, was,",10987
"10988",141,"by this time, not very far from classing Mrs. Norris as one of those",10988
"10989",141,"well-meaning people who are always doing mistaken and very disagreeable",10989
"10990",141,"things.",10990
"10991",141,"",10991
"10992",141,"Mrs. Norris, however, relieved him. He pressed for the strictest",10992
"10993",141,"forbearance and silence towards their niece; she not only promised, but",10993
"10994",141,"did observe it. She only looked her increased ill-will. Angry she was:",10994
"10995",141,"bitterly angry; but she was more angry with Fanny for having received",10995
"10996",141,"such an offer than for refusing it. It was an injury and affront to",10996
"10997",141,"Julia, who ought to have been Mr. Crawford’s choice; and, independently",10997
"10998",141,"of that, she disliked Fanny, because she had neglected her; and she",10998
"10999",141,"would have grudged such an elevation to one whom she had been always",10999
"11000",141,"trying to depress.",11000
"11001",141,"",11001
"11002",141,"Sir Thomas gave her more credit for discretion on the occasion than she",11002
"11003",141,"deserved; and Fanny could have blessed her for allowing her only to see",11003
"11004",141,"her displeasure, and not to hear it.",11004
"11005",141,"",11005
"11006",141,"Lady Bertram took it differently. She had been a beauty, and a",11006
"11007",141,"prosperous beauty, all her life; and beauty and wealth were all that",11007
"11008",141,"excited her respect. To know Fanny to be sought in marriage by a man of",11008
"11009",141,"fortune, raised her, therefore, very much in her opinion. By convincing",11009
"11010",141,"her that Fanny _was_ very pretty, which she had been doubting about",11010
"11011",141,"before, and that she would be advantageously married, it made her feel",11011
"11012",141,"a sort of credit in calling her niece.",11012
"11013",141,"",11013
"11014",141,"“Well, Fanny,” said she, as soon as they were alone together",11014
"11015",141,"afterwards, and she really had known something like impatience to be",11015
"11016",141,"alone with her, and her countenance, as she spoke, had extraordinary",11016
"11017",141,"animation; “Well, Fanny, I have had a very agreeable surprise this",11017
"11018",141,"morning. I must just speak of it _once_, I told Sir Thomas I must",11018

"11038",141,"years and a half. It silenced her. She felt how unprofitable contention",11038
"11039",141,"would be. If her aunt’s feelings were against her, nothing could be",11039

"11061",141,"appearance of Henry Crawford and his sister walking together through",11061
"11062",141,"the village as he rode into it. He had concluded—he had meant them to",11062
"11063",141,"be far distant. His absence had been extended beyond a fortnight",11063
"11064",141,"purposely to avoid Miss Crawford. He was returning to Mansfield with",11064
"11065",141,"spirits ready to feed on melancholy remembrances, and tender",11065
"11066",141,"associations, when her own fair self was before him, leaning on her",11066
"11067",141,"brother’s arm, and he found himself receiving a welcome, unquestionably",11067
"11068",141,"friendly, from the woman whom, two moments before, he had been thinking",11068
"11069",141,"of as seventy miles off, and as farther, much farther, from him in",11069
"11070",141,"inclination than any distance could express.",11070
"11071",141,"",11071
"11072",141,"Her reception of him was of a sort which he could not have hoped for,",11072
"11073",141,"had he expected to see her. Coming as he did from such a purport",11073
"11074",141,"fulfilled as had taken him away, he would have expected anything rather",11074
"11075",141,"than a look of satisfaction, and words of simple, pleasant meaning. It",11075
"11076",141,"was enough to set his heart in a glow, and to bring him home in the",11076

"11092",141,"Edmund again, she felt dreadfully guilty. He came to her, sat down by",11092
"11093",141,"her, took her hand, and pressed it kindly; and at that moment she",11093
"11094",141,"thought that, but for the occupation and the scene which the tea-things",11094
"11095",141,"afforded, she must have betrayed her emotion in some unpardonable",11095
"11096",141,"excess.",11096

"11098",141,"He was not intending, however, by such action, to be conveying to her",11098
"11099",141,"that unqualified approbation and encouragement which her hopes drew",11099
"11100",141,"from it. It was designed only to express his participation in all that",11100
"11101",141,"interested her, and to tell her that he had been hearing what quickened",11101
"11102",141,"every feeling of affection. He was, in fact, entirely on his father’s",11102
"11103",141,"side of the question. His surprise was not so great as his father’s at",11103
"11104",141,"her refusing Crawford, because, so far from supposing her to consider",11104
"11105",141,"him with anything like a preference, he had always believed it to be",11105
"11106",141,"rather the reverse, and could imagine her to be taken perfectly",11106
"11107",141,"unprepared, but Sir Thomas could not regard the connexion as more",11107
"11108",141,"desirable than he did. It had every recommendation to him; and while",11108

"11110",141,"indifference, honouring her in rather stronger terms than Sir Thomas",11110
"11111",141,"could quite echo, he was most earnest in hoping, and sanguine in",11111
"11112",141,"believing, that it would be a match at last, and that, united by mutual",11112
"11113",141,"affection, it would appear that their dispositions were as exactly",11113
"11114",141,"fitted to make them blessed in each other, as he was now beginning",11114
"11115",141,"seriously to consider them. Crawford had been too precipitate. He had",11115
"11116",141,"not given her time to attach herself. He had begun at the wrong end.",11116
"11117",141,"With such powers as his, however, and such a disposition as hers,",11117
"11118",141,"Edmund trusted that everything would work out a happy conclusion.",11118
"11119",141,"Meanwhile, he saw enough of Fanny’s embarrassment to make him",11119
"11120",141,"scrupulously guard against exciting it a second time, by any word, or",11120
"11121",141,"look, or movement.",11121
"11122",141,"",11122
"11123",141,"Crawford called the next day, and on the score of Edmund’s return, Sir",11123
"11124",141,"Thomas felt himself more than licensed to ask him to stay dinner; it",11124
"11125",141,"was really a necessary compliment. He staid of course, and Edmund had",11125
"11126",141,"then ample opportunity for observing how he sped with Fanny, and what",11126
"11127",141,"degree of immediate encouragement for him might be extracted from her",11127
"11128",141,"manners; and it was so little, so very, very little—every chance, every",11128
"11129",141,"possibility of it, resting upon her embarrassment only; if there was",11129
"11130",141,"not hope in her confusion, there was hope in nothing else—that he was",11130
"11131",141,"almost ready to wonder at his friend’s perseverance. Fanny was worth it",11131
"11132",141,"all; he held her to be worth every effort of patience, every exertion",11132
"11133",141,"of mind, but he did not think he could have gone on himself with any",11133
"11134",141,"woman breathing, without something more to warm his courage than his",11134
"11135",141,"eyes could discern in hers. He was very willing to hope that Crawford",11135
"11136",141,"saw clearer, and this was the most comfortable conclusion for his",11136

"11142",141,"mother and Fanny were sitting as intently and silently at work as if",11142
"11143",141,"there were nothing else to care for. Edmund could not help noticing",11143
"11144",141,"their apparently deep tranquillity.",11144
"11145",141,"",11145
"11146",141,"“We have not been so silent all the time,” replied his mother. “Fanny",11146
"11147",141,"has been reading to me, and only put the book down upon hearing you",11147
"11148",141,"coming.” And sure enough there was a book on the table which had the",11148
"11149",141,"air of being very recently closed: a volume of Shakespeare. “She often",11149
"11150",141,"reads to me out of those books; and she was in the middle of a very",11150
"11151",141,"fine speech of that man’s—what’s his name, Fanny?—when we heard your",11151

"11156",141,"by carefully giving way to the inclination of the leaves, he did find",11156
"11157",141,"it, or within a page or two, quite near enough to satisfy Lady Bertram,",11157
"11158",141,"who assured him, as soon as he mentioned the name of Cardinal Wolsey,",11158
"11159",141,"that he had got the very speech. Not a look or an offer of help had",11159
"11160",141,"Fanny given; not a syllable for or against. All her attention was for",11160
"11161",141,"her work. She seemed determined to be interested by nothing else. But",11161
"11162",141,"taste was too strong in her. She could not abstract her mind five",11162
"11163",141,"minutes: she was forced to listen; his reading was capital, and her",11163
"11164",141,"pleasure in good reading extreme. To _good_ reading, however, she had",11164
"11165",141,"been long used: her uncle read well, her cousins all, Edmund very well,",11165
"11166",141,"but in Mr. Crawford’s reading there was a variety of excellence beyond",11166
"11167",141,"what she had ever met with. The King, the Queen, Buckingham, Wolsey,",11167
"11168",141,"Cromwell, all were given in turn; for with the happiest knack, the",11168
"11169",141,"happiest power of jumping and guessing, he could always alight at will",11169
"11170",141,"on the best scene, or the best speeches of each; and whether it were",11170
"11171",141,"dignity, or pride, or tenderness, or remorse, or whatever were to be",11171
"11172",141,"expressed, he could do it with equal beauty. It was truly dramatic. His",11172
"11173",141,"acting had first taught Fanny what pleasure a play might give, and his",11173
"11174",141,"reading brought all his acting before her again; nay, perhaps with",11174
"11175",141,"greater enjoyment, for it came unexpectedly, and with no such drawback",11175
"11176",141,"as she had been used to suffer in seeing him on the stage with Miss",11176
"11177",141,"Bertram.",11177
"11178",141,"",11178
"11179",141,"Edmund watched the progress of her attention, and was amused and",11179
"11180",141,"gratified by seeing how she gradually slackened in the needlework,",11180
"11181",141,"which at the beginning seemed to occupy her totally: how it fell from",11181
"11182",141,"her hand while she sat motionless over it, and at last, how the eyes",11182
"11183",141,"which had appeared so studiously to avoid him throughout the day were",11183
"11184",141,"turned and fixed on Crawford—fixed on him for minutes, fixed on him, in",11184
"11185",141,"short, till the attraction drew Crawford’s upon her, and the book was",11185
"11186",141,"closed, and the charm was broken. Then she was shrinking again into",11186
"11187",141,"herself, and blushing and working as hard as ever; but it had been",11187
"11188",141,"enough to give Edmund encouragement for his friend, and as he cordially",11188

"11825",141,"could tell, or could leave to be conjectured of her sentiments, and he",11825
"11826",141,"was satisfied. It had been, as he before presumed, too hasty a measure",11826
"11827",141,"on Crawford’s side, and time must be given to make the idea first",11827
"11828",141,"familiar, and then agreeable to her. She must be used to the",11828
"11829",141,"consideration of his being in love with her, and then a return of",11829
"11830",141,"affection might not be very distant.",11830

"11832",141,"He gave this opinion as the result of the conversation to his father;",11832

"11834",141,"attempts to influence or persuade; but that everything should be left",11834
"11835",141,"to Crawford’s assiduities, and the natural workings of her own mind.",11835
"11836",141,"",11836
"11837",141,"Sir Thomas promised that it should be so. Edmund’s account of Fanny’s",11837
"11838",141,"disposition he could believe to be just; he supposed she had all those",11838
"11839",141,"feelings, but he must consider it as very unfortunate that she _had_;",11839
"11840",141,"for, less willing than his son to trust to the future, he could not",11840
"11841",141,"help fearing that if such very long allowances of time and habit were",11841
"11842",141,"necessary for her, she might not have persuaded herself into receiving",11842
"11843",141,"his addresses properly before the young man’s inclination for paying",11843
"11844",141,"them were over. There was nothing to be done, however, but to submit",11844

"11847",141,"The promised visit from “her friend,” as Edmund called Miss Crawford,",11847
"11848",141,"was a formidable threat to Fanny, and she lived in continual terror of",11848
"11849",141,"it. As a sister, so partial and so angry, and so little scrupulous of",11849
"11850",141,"what she said, and in another light so triumphant and secure, she was",11850
"11851",141,"in every way an object of painful alarm. Her displeasure, her",11851
"11852",141,"penetration, and her happiness were all fearful to encounter; and the",11852
"11853",141,"dependence of having others present when they met was Fanny’s only",11853
"11854",141,"support in looking forward to it. She absented herself as little as",11854
"11855",141,"possible from Lady Bertram, kept away from the East room, and took no",11855
"11856",141,"solitary walk in the shrubbery, in her caution to avoid any sudden",11856
"11857",141,"attack.",11857
"11858",141,"",11858
"11859",141,"She succeeded. She was safe in the breakfast-room, with her aunt, when",11859
"11860",141,"Miss Crawford did come; and the first misery over, and Miss Crawford",11860
"11861",141,"looking and speaking with much less particularity of expression than",11861
"11862",141,"she had anticipated, Fanny began to hope there would be nothing worse",11862
"11863",141,"to be endured than a half-hour of moderate agitation. But here she",11863
"11864",141,"hoped too much; Miss Crawford was not the slave of opportunity. She was",11864
"11865",141,"determined to see Fanny alone, and therefore said to her tolerably",11865
"11866",141,"soon, in a low voice, “I must speak to you for a few minutes",11866
"11867",141,"somewhere”; words that Fanny felt all over her, in all her pulses and",11867
"11868",141,"all her nerves. Denial was impossible. Her habits of ready submission,",11868
"11869",141,"on the contrary, made her almost instantly rise and lead the way out of",11869
"11870",141,"the room. She did it with wretched feelings, but it was inevitable.",11870
"11871",141,"",11871
"11872",141,"They were no sooner in the hall than all restraint of countenance was",11872
"11873",141,"over on Miss Crawford’s side. She immediately shook her head at Fanny",11873
"11874",141,"with arch, yet affectionate reproach, and taking her hand, seemed",11874
"11875",141,"hardly able to help beginning directly. She said nothing, however, but,",11875
"11876",141,"“Sad, sad girl! I do not know when I shall have done scolding you,” and",11876
"11877",141,"had discretion enough to reserve the rest till they might be secure of",11877
"11878",141,"having four walls to themselves. Fanny naturally turned upstairs, and",11878
"11879",141,"took her guest to the apartment which was now always fit for",11879
"11880",141,"comfortable use; opening the door, however, with a most aching heart,",11880
"11881",141,"and feeling that she had a more distressing scene before her than ever",11881
"11882",141,"that spot had yet witnessed. But the evil ready to burst on her was at",11882
"11883",141,"least delayed by the sudden change in Miss Crawford’s ideas; by the",11883
"11884",141,"strong effect on her mind which the finding herself in the East room",11884
"11885",141,"again produced.",11885
"11886",141,"",11886
"11887",141,"“Ha!” she cried, with instant animation, “am I here again? The East",11887
"11888",141,"room! Once only was I in this room before”; and after stopping to look",11888
"11889",141,"about her, and seemingly to retrace all that had then passed, she",11889
"11890",141,"added, “Once only before. Do you remember it? I came to rehearse. Your",11890
"11891",141,"cousin came too; and we had a rehearsal. You were our audience and",11891
"11892",141,"prompter. A delightful rehearsal. I shall never forget it. Here we",11892
"11893",141,"were, just in this part of the room: here was your cousin, here was I,",11893
"11894",141,"here were the chairs. Oh! why will such things ever pass away?”",11894
"11895",141,"",11895
"11896",141,"Happily for her companion, she wanted no answer. Her mind was entirely",11896
"11897",141,"self-engrossed. She was in a reverie of sweet remembrances.",11897
"11898",141,"",11898
"11899",141,"“The scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable! The subject of it",11899
"11900",141,"so very—very—what shall I say? He was to be describing and recommending",11900
"11901",141,"matrimony to me. I think I see him now, trying to be as demure and",11901
"11902",141,"composed as Anhalt ought, through the two long speeches. ‘When two",11902
"11903",141,"sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state, matrimony may be called",11903
"11904",141,"a happy life.’ I suppose no time can ever wear out the impression I",11904
"11905",141,"have of his looks and voice as he said those words. It was curious,",11905
"11906",141,"very curious, that we should have such a scene to play! If I had the",11906
"11907",141,"power of recalling any one week of my existence, it should be that",11907
"11908",141,"week—that acting week. Say what you would, Fanny, it should be _that_;",11908
"11909",141,"for I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other. His sturdy",11909
"11910",141,"spirit to bend as it did! Oh! it was sweet beyond expression. But alas,",11910
"11911",141,"that very evening destroyed it all. That very evening brought your most",11911
"11912",141,"unwelcome uncle. Poor Sir Thomas, who was glad to see you? Yet, Fanny,",11912
"11913",141,"do not imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas, though",11913
"11914",141,"I certainly did hate him for many a week. No, I do him justice now. He",11914
"11915",141,"is just what the head of such a family should be. Nay, in sober",11915
"11916",141,"sadness, I believe I now love you all.” And having said so, with a",11916
"11917",141,"degree of tenderness and consciousness which Fanny had never seen in",11917
"11918",141,"her before, and now thought only too becoming, she turned away for a",11918
"11919",141,"moment to recover herself. “I have had a little fit since I came into",11919
"11920",141,"this room, as you may perceive,” said she presently, with a playful",11920
"11921",141,"smile, “but it is over now; so let us sit down and be comfortable; for",11921
"11922",141,"as to scolding you, Fanny, which I came fully intending to do, I have",11922
"11923",141,"not the heart for it when it comes to the point.” And embracing her",11923
"11924",141,"very affectionately, “Good, gentle Fanny! when I think of this being",11924
"11925",141,"the last time of seeing you for I do not know how long, I feel it quite",11925
"11926",141,"impossible to do anything but love you.”",11926
"11927",141,"",11927
"11928",141,"Fanny was affected. She had not foreseen anything of this, and her",11928
"11929",141,"feelings could seldom withstand the melancholy influence of the word",11929
"11930",141,"“last.” She cried as if she had loved Miss Crawford more than she",11930
"11931",141,"possibly could; and Miss Crawford, yet farther softened by the sight of",11931
"11932",141,"such emotion, hung about her with fondness, and said, “I hate to leave",11932
"11933",141,"you. I shall see no one half so amiable where I am going. Who says we",11933
"11934",141,"shall not be sisters? I know we shall. I feel that we are born to be",11934
"11935",141,"connected; and those tears convince me that you feel it too, dear",11935
"11936",141,"Fanny.”",11936
"11937",141,"",11937
"11938",141,"Fanny roused herself, and replying only in part, said, “But you are",11938

"11944",141,"the friends I am leaving: my excellent sister, yourself, and the",11944
"11945",141,"Bertrams in general. You have all so much more _heart_ among you than",11945
"11946",141,"one finds in the world at large. You all give me a feeling of being",11946
"11947",141,"able to trust and confide in you, which in common intercourse one knows",11947
"11948",141,"nothing of. I wish I had settled with Mrs. Fraser not to go to her till",11948
"11949",141,"after Easter, a much better time for the visit, but now I cannot put",11949
"11950",141,"her off. And when I have done with her I must go to her sister, Lady",11950

"11956",141,"the world, Mary on something of less philosophic tendency. _She_ first",11956
"11957",141,"spoke again.",11957

"11972",141,"short time into our circle in town, that you might understand how your",11972
"11973",141,"power over Henry is thought of there! Oh! the envyings and",11973
"11974",141,"heartburnings of dozens and dozens; the wonder, the incredulity that",11974
"11975",141,"will be felt at hearing what you have done! For as to secrecy, Henry is",11975
"11976",141,"quite the hero of an old romance, and glories in his chains. You should",11976
"11977",141,"come to London to know how to estimate your conquest. If you were to",11977
"11978",141,"see how he is courted, and how I am courted for his sake! Now, I am",11978
"11979",141,"well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in",11979
"11980",141,"consequence of his situation with you. When she comes to know the truth",11980
"11981",141,"she will, very likely, wish me in Northamptonshire again; for there is",11981
"11982",141,"a daughter of Mr. Fraser, by a first wife, whom she is wild to get",11982
"11983",141,"married, and wants Henry to take. Oh! she has been trying for him to",11983
"11984",141,"such a degree. Innocent and quiet as you sit here, you cannot have an",11984
"11985",141,"idea of the _sensation_ that you will be occasioning, of the curiosity",11985
"11986",141,"there will be to see you, of the endless questions I shall have to",11986
"11987",141,"answer! Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and",11987
"11988",141,"your teeth, and how you do your hair, and who makes your shoes. I wish",11988
"11989",141,"Margaret were married, for my poor friend’s sake, for I look upon the",11989
"11990",141,"Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people. And yet it",11990
"11991",141,"was a most desirable match for Janet at the time. We were all",11991
"11992",141,"delighted. She could not do otherwise than accept him, for he was rich,",11992
"11993",141,"and she had nothing; but he turns out ill-tempered and _exigeant_, and",11993
"11994",141,"wants a young woman, a beautiful young woman of five-and-twenty, to be",11994
"11995",141,"as steady as himself. And my friend does not manage him well; she does",11995
"11996",141,"not seem to know how to make the best of it. There is a spirit of",11996
"11997",141,"irritation which, to say nothing worse, is certainly very ill-bred. In",11997
"11998",141,"their house I shall call to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield",11998
"11999",141,"Parsonage with respect. Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence",11999
"12000",141,"in my sister, and a certain consideration for her judgment, which makes",12000
"12001",141,"one feel there _is_ attachment; but of that I shall see nothing with",12001
"12002",141,"the Frasers. I shall be at Mansfield for ever, Fanny. My own sister as",12002
"12003",141,"a wife, Sir Thomas Bertram as a husband, are my standards of",12003
"12004",141,"perfection. Poor Janet has been sadly taken in, and yet there was",12004
"12005",141,"nothing improper on her side: she did not run into the match",12005
"12006",141,"inconsiderately; there was no want of foresight. She took three days to",12006
"12007",141,"consider of his proposals, and during those three days asked the advice",12007
"12008",141,"of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having, and",12008
"12009",141,"especially applied to my late dear aunt, whose knowledge of the world",12009
"12010",141,"made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the",12010
"12011",141,"young people of her acquaintance, and she was decidedly in favour of",12011
"12012",141,"Mr. Fraser. This seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial",12012
"12013",141,"comfort. I have not so much to say for my friend Flora, who jilted a",12013
"12014",141,"very nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord",12014
"12015",141,"Stornaway, who has about as much sense, Fanny, as Mr. Rushworth, but",12015
"12016",141,"much worse-looking, and with a blackguard character. I _had_ my doubts",12016
"12017",141,"at the time about her being right, for he has not even the air of a",12017
"12018",141,"gentleman, and now I am sure she was wrong. By the bye, Flora Ross was",12018
"12019",141,"dying for Henry the first winter she came out. But were I to attempt to",12019
"12020",141,"tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him, I",12020
"12021",141,"should never have done. It is you, only you, insensible Fanny, who can",12021

"12048",141,"first—indeed, indeed I was. It is as true as that I sit here. And had I",12048
"12049",141,"had an idea of it, nothing should have induced me to accept the",12049
"12050",141,"necklace. As to your brother’s behaviour, certainly I was sensible of a",12050
"12051",141,"particularity: I had been sensible of it some little time, perhaps two",12051

"12053",141,"down as simply being his way, and was as far from supposing as from",12053
"12054",141,"wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me. I had not, Miss",12054
"12055",141,"Crawford, been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him",12055
"12056",141,"and some part of this family in the summer and autumn. I was quiet, but",12056

"12063",141,"and there is this to be said, that very few young ladies have any",12063

"12075",141,"this I will say, that his fault, the liking to make girls a little in",12075

"12158",141,"Mr. Crawford gone, Sir Thomas’s next object was that he should be",12158

"12160",141,"in the loss of those attentions which at the time she had felt, or",12160
"12161",141,"fancied, an evil. She had tasted of consequence in its most flattering",12161
"12162",141,"form; and he did hope that the loss of it, the sinking again into",12162
"12163",141,"nothing, would awaken very wholesome regrets in her mind. He watched",12163
"12164",141,"her with this idea; but he could hardly tell with what success. He",12164
"12165",141,"hardly knew whether there were any difference in her spirits or not.",12165
"12166",141,"She was always so gentle and retiring that her emotions were beyond his",12166
"12167",141,"discrimination. He did not understand her: he felt that he did not; and",12167
"12168",141,"therefore applied to Edmund to tell him how she stood affected on the",12168
"12169",141,"present occasion, and whether she were more or less happy than she had",12169
"12170",141,"been.",12170
"12171",141,"",12171
"12172",141,"Edmund did not discern any symptoms of regret, and thought his father a",12172

"12174",141,"produce any.",12174
"12175",141,"",12175
"12176",141,"What chiefly surprised Edmund was, that Crawford’s sister, the friend",12176
"12177",141,"and companion who had been so much to her, should not be more visibly",12177
"12178",141,"regretted. He wondered that Fanny spoke so seldom of _her_, and had so",12178
"12179",141,"little voluntarily to say of her concern at this separation.",12179
"12180",141,"",12180
"12181",141,"Alas! it was this sister, this friend and companion, who was now the",12181
"12182",141,"chief bane of Fanny’s comfort. If she could have believed Mary’s future",12182
"12183",141,"fate as unconnected with Mansfield as she was determined the brother’s",12183
"12184",141,"should be, if she could have hoped her return thither to be as distant",12184
"12185",141,"as she was much inclined to think his, she would have been light of",12185
"12186",141,"heart indeed; but the more she recollected and observed, the more",12186
"12187",141,"deeply was she convinced that everything was now in a fairer train for",12187
"12188",141,"Miss Crawford’s marrying Edmund than it had ever been before. On his",12188
"12189",141,"side the inclination was stronger, on hers less equivocal. His",12189
"12190",141,"objections, the scruples of his integrity, seemed all done away, nobody",12190
"12191",141,"could tell how; and the doubts and hesitations of her ambition were",12191
"12192",141,"equally got over—and equally without apparent reason. It could only be",12192
"12193",141,"imputed to increasing attachment. His good and her bad feelings yielded",12193
"12194",141,"to love, and such love must unite them. He was to go to town as soon as",12194
"12195",141,"some business relative to Thornton Lacey were completed—perhaps within",12195
"12196",141,"a fortnight; he talked of going, he loved to talk of it; and when once",12196
"12197",141,"with her again, Fanny could not doubt the rest. Her acceptance must be",12197
"12198",141,"as certain as his offer; and yet there were bad feelings still",12198
"12199",141,"remaining which made the prospect of it most sorrowful to her,",12199

"12202",141,"In their very last conversation, Miss Crawford, in spite of some",12202
"12203",141,"amiable sensations, and much personal kindness, had still been Miss",12203
"12204",141,"Crawford; still shewn a mind led astray and bewildered, and without any",12204
"12205",141,"suspicion of being so; darkened, yet fancying itself light. She might",12205
"12206",141,"love, but she did not deserve Edmund by any other sentiment. Fanny",12206
"12207",141,"believed there was scarcely a second feeling in common between them;",12207
"12208",141,"and she may be forgiven by older sages for looking on the chance of",12208
"12209",141,"Miss Crawford’s future improvement as nearly desperate, for thinking",12209
"12210",141,"that if Edmund’s influence in this season of love had already done so",12210
"12211",141,"little in clearing her judgment, and regulating her notions, his worth",12211

"12216",141,"participation of the general nature of women which would lead her to",12216
"12217",141,"adopt the opinions of the man she loved and respected as her own. But",12217
"12218",141,"as such were Fanny’s persuasions, she suffered very much from them, and",12218
"12219",141,"could never speak of Miss Crawford without pain.",12219
"12220",141,"",12220
"12221",141,"Sir Thomas, meanwhile, went on with his own hopes and his own",12221
"12222",141,"observations, still feeling a right, by all his knowledge of human",12222
"12223",141,"nature, to expect to see the effect of the loss of power and",12223
"12224",141,"consequence on his niece’s spirits, and the past attentions of the",12224
"12225",141,"lover producing a craving for their return; and he was soon afterwards",12225
"12226",141,"able to account for his not yet completely and indubitably seeing all",12226
"12227",141,"this, by the prospect of another visitor, whose approach he could allow",12227
"12228",141,"to be quite enough to support the spirits he was watching. William had",12228
"12229",141,"obtained a ten days’ leave of absence, to be given to Northamptonshire,",12229
"12230",141,"and was coming, the happiest of lieutenants, because the latest made,",12230

"12232",141,"",12232
"12233",141,"He came; and he would have been delighted to shew his uniform there",12233
"12234",141,"too, had not cruel custom prohibited its appearance except on duty. So",12234
"12235",141,"the uniform remained at Portsmouth, and Edmund conjectured that before",12235
"12236",141,"Fanny had any chance of seeing it, all its own freshness and all the",12236
"12237",141,"freshness of its wearer’s feelings must be worn away. It would be sunk",12237
"12238",141,"into a badge of disgrace; for what can be more unbecoming, or more",12238
"12239",141,"worthless, than the uniform of a lieutenant, who has been a lieutenant",12239
"12240",141,"a year or two, and sees others made commanders before him? So reasoned",12240
"12241",141,"Edmund, till his father made him the confidant of a scheme which placed",12241
"12242",141,"Fanny’s chance of seeing the second lieutenant of H.M.S. Thrush in all",12242
"12243",141,"his glory in another light.",12243
"12244",141,"",12244
"12245",141,"This scheme was that she should accompany her brother back to",12245
"12246",141,"Portsmouth, and spend a little time with her own family. It had",12246
"12247",141,"occurred to Sir Thomas, in one of his dignified musings, as a right and",12247
"12248",141,"desirable measure; but before he absolutely made up his mind, he",12248
"12249",141,"consulted his son. Edmund considered it every way, and saw nothing but",12249
"12250",141,"what was right. The thing was good in itself, and could not be done at",12250
"12251",141,"a better time; and he had no doubt of it being highly agreeable to",12251
"12252",141,"Fanny. This was enough to determine Sir Thomas; and a decisive “then so",12252
"12253",141,"it shall be” closed that stage of the business; Sir Thomas retiring",12253
"12254",141,"from it with some feelings of satisfaction, and views of good over and",12254
"12255",141,"above what he had communicated to his son; for his prime motive in",12255
"12256",141,"sending her away had very little to do with the propriety of her seeing",12256
"12257",141,"her parents again, and nothing at all with any idea of making her",12257
"12258",141,"happy. He certainly wished her to go willingly, but he as certainly",12258
"12259",141,"wished her to be heartily sick of home before her visit ended; and that",12259
"12260",141,"a little abstinence from the elegancies and luxuries of Mansfield Park",12260
"12261",141,"would bring her mind into a sober state, and incline her to a juster",12261
"12262",141,"estimate of the value of that home of greater permanence, and equal",12262
"12263",141,"comfort, of which she had the offer.",12263

"12267",141,"years in the abode of wealth and plenty had a little disordered her",12267
"12268",141,"powers of comparing and judging. Her father’s house would, in all",12268
"12269",141,"probability, teach her the value of a good income; and he trusted that",12269

"12275",141,"uncle first made her the offer of visiting the parents, and brothers,",12275
"12276",141,"and sisters, from whom she had been divided almost half her life; of",12276
"12277",141,"returning for a couple of months to the scenes of her infancy, with",12277
"12278",141,"William for the protector and companion of her journey, and the",12278
"12279",141,"certainty of continuing to see William to the last hour of his",12279
"12280",141,"remaining on land. Had she ever given way to bursts of delight, it must",12280
"12281",141,"have been then, for she was delighted, but her happiness was of a",12281
"12282",141,"quiet, deep, heart-swelling sort; and though never a great talker, she",12282
"12283",141,"was always more inclined to silence when feeling most strongly. At the",12283
"12284",141,"moment she could only thank and accept. Afterwards, when familiarised",12284
"12285",141,"with the visions of enjoyment so suddenly opened, she could speak more",12285
"12286",141,"largely to William and Edmund of what she felt; but still there were",12286

"12288",141,"remembrance of all her earliest pleasures, and of what she had suffered",12288
"12289",141,"in being torn from them, came over her with renewed strength, and it",12289

"13193",141,"that it would not be unbecoming in her to make such a present. It was",13193
"13194",141,"made, however, at last: a silver knife was bought for Betsey, and",13194
"13195",141,"accepted with great delight, its newness giving it every advantage over",13195
"13196",141,"the other that could be desired; Susan was established in the full",13196
"13197",141,"possession of her own, Betsey handsomely declaring that now she had got",13197
"13198",141,"one so much prettier herself, she should never want _that_ again; and",13198
"13199",141,"no reproach seemed conveyed to the equally satisfied mother, which",13199

"13212",141,"worth of her disposition and perceiving how fully she was inclined to",13212
"13213",141,"seek her good opinion and refer to her judgment, began to feel again",13213
"13214",141,"the blessing of affection, and to entertain the hope of being useful to",13214
"13215",141,"a mind so much in need of help, and so much deserving it. She gave",13215
"13216",141,"advice, advice too sound to be resisted by a good understanding, and",13216
"13217",141,"given so mildly and considerately as not to irritate an imperfect",13217
"13218",141,"temper, and she had the happiness of observing its good effects not",13218
"13219",141,"unfrequently. More was not expected by one who, while seeing all the",13219

"13221",141,"sympathetic acuteness of feeling all that must be hourly grating to a",13221

"13224",141,"against her better knowledge—but that so much better knowledge, so many",13224

"13233",141,"it no misfortune to be quietly employed. They sat without a fire; but",13233
"13234",141,"that was a privation familiar even to Fanny, and she suffered the less",13234
"13235",141,"because reminded by it of the East room. It was the only point of",13235
"13236",141,"resemblance. In space, light, furniture, and prospect, there was",13236
"13237",141,"nothing alike in the two apartments; and she often heaved a sigh at the",13237
"13238",141,"remembrance of all her books and boxes, and various comforts there. By",13238

"13241",141,"remembrance of the said books grew so potent and stimulative that Fanny",13241
"13242",141,"found it impossible not to try for books again. There were none in her",13242
"13243",141,"father’s house; but wealth is luxurious and daring, and some of hers",13243
"13244",141,"found its way to a circulating library. She became a subscriber; amazed",13244

"13303",141,"Mrs. Price’s manners were also at their best. Warmed by the sight of",13303

"13309",141,"uneasiness was added the severe one of shame for the home in which he",13309
"13310",141,"found her. She might scold herself for the weakness, but there was no",13310
"13311",141,"scolding it away. She was ashamed, and she would have been yet more",13311

"13328",141,"By the time he had given all this information, it was not unreasonable",13328

"13344",141,"",13344
"13345",141,"After talking a little more about Mansfield, a subject in which her",13345
"13346",141,"interest was most apparent, Crawford began to hint at the expediency of",13346
"13347",141,"an early walk. “It was a lovely morning, and at that season of the year",13347
"13348",141,"a fine morning so often turned off, that it was wisest for everybody",13348
"13349",141,"not to delay their exercise”; and such hints producing nothing, he soon",13349
"13350",141,"proceeded to a positive recommendation to Mrs. Price and her daughters",13350
"13351",141,"to take their walk without loss of time. Now they came to an",13351
"13352",141,"understanding. Mrs. Price, it appeared, scarcely ever stirred out of",13352
"13353",141,"doors, except of a Sunday; she owned she could seldom, with her large",13353
"13354",141,"family, find time for a walk. “Would she not, then, persuade her",13354
"13355",141,"daughters to take advantage of such weather, and allow him the pleasure",13355
"13356",141,"of attending them?” Mrs. Price was greatly obliged and very complying.",13356
"13357",141,"“Her daughters were very much confined; Portsmouth was a sad place;",13357
"13358",141,"they did not often get out; and she knew they had some errands in the",13358

"13360",141,"that Fanny, strange as it was—strange, awkward, and distressing—found",13360
"13361",141,"herself and Susan, within ten minutes, walking towards the High Street",13361
"13362",141,"with Mr. Crawford.",13362

"13364",141,"It was soon pain upon pain, confusion upon confusion; for they were",13364
"13365",141,"hardly in the High Street before they met her father, whose appearance",13365
"13366",141,"was not the better from its being Saturday. He stopt; and,",13366
"13367",141,"ungentlemanlike as he looked, Fanny was obliged to introduce him to Mr.",13367
"13368",141,"Crawford. She could not have a doubt of the manner in which Mr.",13368
"13369",141,"Crawford must be struck. He must be ashamed and disgusted altogether.",13369
"13370",141,"He must soon give her up, and cease to have the smallest inclination",13370
"13371",141,"for the match; and yet, though she had been so much wanting his",13371
"13372",141,"affection to be cured, this was a sort of cure that would be almost as",13372
"13373",141,"bad as the complaint; and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in",13373
"13374",141,"the United Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of",13374
"13375",141,"being sought by a clever, agreeable man, than have him driven away by",13375
"13376",141,"the vulgarity of her nearest relations.",13376

"13378",141,"Mr. Crawford probably could not regard his future father-in-law with",13378
"13379",141,"any idea of taking him for a model in dress; but (as Fanny instantly,",13379
"13380",141,"and to her great relief, discerned) her father was a very different",13380
"13381",141,"man, a very different Mr. Price in his behaviour to this most highly",13381
"13382",141,"respected stranger, from what he was in his own family at home. His",13382
"13383",141,"manners now, though not polished, were more than passable: they were",13383
"13384",141,"grateful, animated, manly; his expressions were those of an attached",13384
"13385",141,"father, and a sensible man; his loud tones did very well in the open",13385
"13386",141,"air, and there was not a single oath to be heard. Such was his",13386
"13387",141,"instinctive compliment to the good manners of Mr. Crawford; and, be the",13387
"13388",141,"consequence what it might, Fanny’s immediate feelings were infinitely",13388
"13389",141,"soothed.",13389
"13390",141,"",13390
"13391",141,"The conclusion of the two gentlemen’s civilities was an offer of Mr.",13391
"13392",141,"Price’s to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard, which Mr. Crawford,",13392
"13393",141,"desirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such, though he",13393
"13394",141,"had seen the dockyard again and again, and hoping to be so much the",13394
"13395",141,"longer with Fanny, was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of, if",13395
"13396",141,"the Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue; and as it was somehow",13396
"13397",141,"or other ascertained, or inferred, or at least acted upon, that they",13397
"13398",141,"were not at all afraid, to the dockyard they were all to go; and but",13398
"13399",141,"for Mr. Crawford, Mr. Price would have turned thither directly, without",13399
"13400",141,"the smallest consideration for his daughters’ errands in the High",13400
"13401",141,"Street. He took care, however, that they should be allowed to go to the",13401
"13402",141,"shops they came out expressly to visit; and it did not delay them long,",13402
"13403",141,"for Fanny could so little bear to excite impatience, or be waited for,",13403
"13404",141,"that before the gentlemen, as they stood at the door, could do more",13404
"13405",141,"than begin upon the last naval regulations, or settle the number of",13405
"13406",141,"three-deckers now in commission, their companions were ready to",13406
"13407",141,"proceed.",13407
"13408",141,"",13408
"13409",141,"They were then to set forward for the dockyard at once, and the walk",13409
"13410",141,"would have been conducted—according to Mr. Crawford’s opinion—in a",13410
"13411",141,"singular manner, had Mr. Price been allowed the entire regulation of",13411
"13412",141,"it, as the two girls, he found, would have been left to follow, and",13412
"13413",141,"keep up with them or not, as they could, while they walked on together",13413
"13414",141,"at their own hasty pace. He was able to introduce some improvement",13414
"13415",141,"occasionally, though by no means to the extent he wished; he absolutely",13415
"13416",141,"would not walk away from them; and at any crossing or any crowd, when",13416
"13417",141,"Mr. Price was only calling out, “Come, girls; come, Fan; come, Sue,",13417
"13418",141,"take care of yourselves; keep a sharp lookout!” he would give them his",13418
"13419",141,"particular attendance.",13419
"13420",141,"",13420
"13421",141,"Once fairly in the dockyard, he began to reckon upon some happy",13421
"13422",141,"intercourse with Fanny, as they were very soon joined by a brother",13422
"13423",141,"lounger of Mr. Price’s, who was come to take his daily survey of how",13423
"13424",141,"things went on, and who must prove a far more worthy companion than",13424
"13425",141,"himself; and after a time the two officers seemed very well satisfied",13425
"13426",141,"going about together, and discussing matters of equal and never-failing",13426
"13427",141,"interest, while the young people sat down upon some timbers in the",13427
"13428",141,"yard, or found a seat on board a vessel in the stocks which they all",13428
"13429",141,"went to look at. Fanny was most conveniently in want of rest. Crawford",13429
"13430",141,"could not have wished her more fatigued or more ready to sit down; but",13430
"13431",141,"he could have wished her sister away. A quick-looking girl of Susan’s",13431
"13432",141,"age was the very worst third in the world: totally different from Lady",13432
"13433",141,"Bertram, all eyes and ears; and there was no introducing the main point",13433
"13434",141,"before her. He must content himself with being only generally",13434
"13435",141,"agreeable, and letting Susan have her share of entertainment, with the",13435
"13436",141,"indulgence, now and then, of a look or hint for the better-informed and",13436
"13437",141,"conscious Fanny. Norfolk was what he had mostly to talk of: there he",13437
"13438",141,"had been some time, and everything there was rising in importance from",13438
"13439",141,"his present schemes. Such a man could come from no place, no society,",13439
"13440",141,"without importing something to amuse; his journeys and his acquaintance",13440
"13441",141,"were all of use, and Susan was entertained in a way quite new to her.",13441
"13442",141,"For Fanny, somewhat more was related than the accidental agreeableness",13442
"13443",141,"of the parties he had been in. For her approbation, the particular",13443
"13444",141,"reason of his going into Norfolk at all, at this unusual time of year,",13444
"13445",141,"was given. It had been real business, relative to the renewal of a",13445
"13446",141,"lease in which the welfare of a large and—he believed—industrious",13446
"13447",141,"family was at stake. He had suspected his agent of some underhand",13447
"13448",141,"dealing; of meaning to bias him against the deserving; and he had",13448
"13449",141,"determined to go himself, and thoroughly investigate the merits of the",13449
"13450",141,"case. He had gone, had done even more good than he had foreseen, had",13450
"13451",141,"been useful to more than his first plan had comprehended, and was now",13451
"13452",141,"able to congratulate himself upon it, and to feel that in performing a",13452
"13453",141,"duty, he had secured agreeable recollections for his own mind. He had",13453
"13454",141,"introduced himself to some tenants whom he had never seen before; he",13454
"13455",141,"had begun making acquaintance with cottages whose very existence,",13455
"13456",141,"though on his own estate, had been hitherto unknown to him. This was",13456
"13457",141,"aimed, and well aimed, at Fanny. It was pleasing to hear him speak so",13457
"13458",141,"properly; here he had been acting as he ought to do. To be the friend",13458
"13459",141,"of the poor and the oppressed! Nothing could be more grateful to her;",13459
"13460",141,"and she was on the point of giving him an approving look, when it was",13460
"13461",141,"all frightened off by his adding a something too pointed of his hoping",13461
"13462",141,"soon to have an assistant, a friend, a guide in every plan of utility",13462
"13463",141,"or charity for Everingham: a somebody that would make Everingham and",13463
"13464",141,"all about it a dearer object than it had ever been yet.",13464
"13465",141,"",13465
"13466",141,"She turned away, and wished he would not say such things. She was",13466
"13467",141,"willing to allow he might have more good qualities than she had been",13467
"13468",141,"wont to suppose. She began to feel the possibility of his turning out",13468
"13469",141,"well at last; but he was and must ever be completely unsuited to her,",13469
"13470",141,"and ought not to think of her.",13470
"13471",141,"",13471
"13472",141,"He perceived that enough had been said of Everingham, and that it would",13472
"13473",141,"be as well to talk of something else, and turned to Mansfield. He could",13473
"13474",141,"not have chosen better; that was a topic to bring back her attention",13474
"13475",141,"and her looks almost instantly. It was a real indulgence to her to hear",13475
"13476",141,"or to speak of Mansfield. Now so long divided from everybody who knew",13476
"13477",141,"the place, she felt it quite the voice of a friend when he mentioned",13477
"13478",141,"it, and led the way to her fond exclamations in praise of its beauties",13478
"13479",141,"and comforts, and by his honourable tribute to its inhabitants allowed",13479
"13480",141,"her to gratify her own heart in the warmest eulogium, in speaking of",13480
"13481",141,"her uncle as all that was clever and good, and her aunt as having the",13481

"13485",141,"forward with the hope of spending much, very much, of his time there;",13485
"13486",141,"always there, or in the neighbourhood. He particularly built upon a",13486
"13487",141,"very happy summer and autumn there this year; he felt that it would be",13487
"13488",141,"so: he depended upon it; a summer and autumn infinitely superior to the",13488
"13489",141,"last. As animated, as diversified, as social, but with circumstances of",13489

"13495",141,"dear; for as to any partnership in Thornton Lacey, as Edmund Bertram",13495

"13510",141,"down for a couple of days on her account, and hers only, and because he",13510

"13794",141,"should listen to me till you were tired, and advise me till you were",13794
"13795",141,"still tired more; but it is impossible to put a hundredth part of my",13795
"13796",141,"great mind on paper, so I will abstain altogether, and leave you to",13796
"13797",141,"guess what you like. I have no news for you. You have politics, of",13797
"13798",141,"course; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names of people",13798
"13799",141,"and parties that fill up my time. I ought to have sent you an account",13799
"13800",141,"of your cousin’s first party, but I was lazy, and now it is too long",13800

"13802",141,"that any of her connexions must have been gratified to witness, and",13802
"13803",141,"that her own dress and manners did her the greatest credit. My friend,",13803
"13804",141,"Mrs. Fraser, is mad for such a house, and it would not make _me_",13804
"13805",141,"miserable. I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter; she seems in high",13805
"13806",141,"spirits, and very happy. I fancy Lord S. is very good-humoured and",13806
"13807",141,"pleasant in his own family, and I do not think him so very ill-looking",13807
"13808",141,"as I did—at least, one sees many worse. He will not do by the side of",13808
"13809",141,"your cousin Edmund. Of the last-mentioned hero, what shall I say? If I",13809
"13810",141,"avoided his name entirely, it would look suspicious. I will say, then,",13810
"13811",141,"that we have seen him two or three times, and that my friends here are",13811
"13812",141,"very much struck with his gentlemanlike appearance. Mrs. Fraser (no bad",13812
"13813",141,"judge) declares she knows but three men in town who have so good a",13813
"13814",141,"person, height, and air; and I must confess, when he dined here the",13814

"13834",141,"cannot anyhow be spared till after the 14th, for _we_ have a party that",13834

"13858",141,"This was Fanny’s most frequent expectation. A house in town—that, she",13858

"13863",141,"Mrs. Fraser! _She_ who had known him intimately half a year! Fanny was",13863
"13864",141,"ashamed of her. Those parts of the letter which related only to Mr.",13864
"13865",141,"Crawford and herself, touched her, in comparison, slightly. Whether Mr.",13865

"13869",141,"meeting between him and Mrs. Rushworth, was all in her worst line of",13869
"13870",141,"conduct, and grossly unkind and ill-judged; but she hoped _he_ would",13870
"13871",141,"not be actuated by any such degrading curiosity. He acknowledged no",13871

"13942",141,"“My Dear Fanny,—Excuse me that I have not written before. Crawford told",13942
"13943",141,"me that you were wishing to hear from me, but I found it impossible to",13943
"13944",141,"write from London, and persuaded myself that you would understand my",13944
"13945",141,"silence. Could I have sent a few happy lines, they should not have been",13945
"13946",141,"wanting, but nothing of that nature was ever in my power. I am returned",13946
"13947",141,"to Mansfield in a less assured state than when I left it. My hopes are",13947
"13948",141,"much weaker. You are probably aware of this already. So very fond of",13948
"13949",141,"you as Miss Crawford is, it is most natural that she should tell you",13949
"13950",141,"enough of her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess at mine. I will",13950
"13951",141,"not be prevented, however, from making my own communication. Our",13951
"13952",141,"confidences in you need not clash. I ask no questions. There is",13952
"13953",141,"something soothing in the idea that we have the same friend, and that",13953
"13954",141,"whatever unhappy differences of opinion may exist between us, we are",13954
"13955",141,"united in our love of you. It will be a comfort to me to tell you how",13955
"13956",141,"things now are, and what are my present plans, if plans I can be said",13956
"13957",141,"to have. I have been returned since Saturday. I was three weeks in",13957
"13958",141,"London, and saw her (for London) very often. I had every attention from",13958
"13959",141,"the Frasers that could be reasonably expected. I dare say I was not",13959
"13960",141,"reasonable in carrying with me hopes of an intercourse at all like that",13960
"13961",141,"of Mansfield. It was her manner, however, rather than any unfrequency",13961
"13962",141,"of meeting. Had she been different when I did see her, I should have",13962
"13963",141,"made no complaint, but from the very first she was altered: my first",13963
"13964",141,"reception was so unlike what I had hoped, that I had almost resolved on",13964
"13965",141,"leaving London again directly. I need not particularise. You know the",13965
"13966",141,"weak side of her character, and may imagine the sentiments and",13966
"13967",141,"expressions which were torturing me. She was in high spirits, and",13967
"13968",141,"surrounded by those who were giving all the support of their own bad",13968
"13969",141,"sense to her too lively mind. I do not like Mrs. Fraser. She is a",13969
"13970",141,"cold-hearted, vain woman, who has married entirely from convenience,",13970
"13971",141,"and though evidently unhappy in her marriage, places her disappointment",13971
"13972",141,"not to faults of judgment, or temper, or disproportion of age, but to",13972
"13973",141,"her being, after all, less affluent than many of her acquaintance,",13973
"13974",141,"especially than her sister, Lady Stornaway, and is the determined",13974
"13975",141,"supporter of everything mercenary and ambitious, provided it be only",13975
"13976",141,"mercenary and ambitious enough. I look upon her intimacy with those two",13976
"13977",141,"sisters as the greatest misfortune of her life and mine. They have been",13977
"13978",141,"leading her astray for years. Could she be detached from them!—and",13978
"13979",141,"sometimes I do not despair of it, for the affection appears to me",13979
"13980",141,"principally on their side. They are very fond of her; but I am sure she",13980
"13981",141,"does not love them as she loves you. When I think of her great",13981
"13982",141,"attachment to you, indeed, and the whole of her judicious, upright",13982
"13983",141,"conduct as a sister, she appears a very different creature, capable of",13983
"13984",141,"everything noble, and I am ready to blame myself for a too harsh",13984
"13985",141,"construction of a playful manner. I cannot give her up, Fanny. She is",13985
"13986",141,"the only woman in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife. If I",13986
"13987",141,"did not believe that she had some regard for me, of course I should not",13987
"13988",141,"say this, but I do believe it. I am convinced that she is not without a",13988
"13989",141,"decided preference. I have no jealousy of any individual. It is the",13989
"13990",141,"influence of the fashionable world altogether that I am jealous of. It",13990
"13991",141,"is the habits of wealth that I fear. Her ideas are not higher than her",13991
"13992",141,"own fortune may warrant, but they are beyond what our incomes united",13992
"13993",141,"could authorise. There is comfort, however, even here. I could better",13993
"13994",141,"bear to lose her because not rich enough, than because of my",13994
"13995",141,"profession. That would only prove her affection not equal to",13995
"13996",141,"sacrifices, which, in fact, I am scarcely justified in asking; and, if",13996
"13997",141,"I am refused, that, I think, will be the honest motive. Her prejudices,",13997
"13998",141,"I trust, are not so strong as they were. You have my thoughts exactly",13998
"13999",141,"as they arise, my dear Fanny; perhaps they are sometimes contradictory,",13999
"14000",141,"but it will not be a less faithful picture of my mind. Having once",14000
"14001",141,"begun, it is a pleasure to me to tell you all I feel. I cannot give her",14001
"14002",141,"up. Connected as we already are, and, I hope, are to be, to give up",14002
"14003",141,"Mary Crawford would be to give up the society of some of those most",14003
"14004",141,"dear to me; to banish myself from the very houses and friends whom,",14004
"14005",141,"under any other distress, I should turn to for consolation. The loss of",14005
"14006",141,"Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and of",14006
"14007",141,"Fanny. Were it a decided thing, an actual refusal, I hope I should know",14007
"14008",141,"how to bear it, and how to endeavour to weaken her hold on my heart,",14008
"14009",141,"and in the course of a few years—but I am writing nonsense. Were I",14009
"14010",141,"refused, I must bear it; and till I am, I can never cease to try for",14010
"14011",141,"her. This is the truth. The only question is _how_? What may be the",14011
"14012",141,"likeliest means? I have sometimes thought of going to London again",14012
"14013",141,"after Easter, and sometimes resolved on doing nothing till she returns",14013
"14014",141,"to Mansfield. Even now, she speaks with pleasure of being in Mansfield",14014
"14015",141,"in June; but June is at a great distance, and I believe I shall write",14015
"14016",141,"to her. I have nearly determined on explaining myself by letter. To be",14016
"14017",141,"at an early certainty is a material object. My present state is",14017
"14018",141,"miserably irksome. Considering everything, I think a letter will be",14018
"14019",141,"decidedly the best method of explanation. I shall be able to write much",14019
"14020",141,"that I could not say, and shall be giving her time for reflection",14020
"14021",141,"before she resolves on her answer, and I am less afraid of the result",14021
"14022",141,"of reflection than of an immediate hasty impulse; I think I am. My",14022
"14023",141,"greatest danger would lie in her consulting Mrs. Fraser, and I at a",14023
"14024",141,"distance unable to help my own cause. A letter exposes to all the evil",14024
"14025",141,"of consultation, and where the mind is anything short of perfect",14025
"14026",141,"decision, an adviser may, in an unlucky moment, lead it to do what it",14026
"14027",141,"may afterwards regret. I must think this matter over a little. This",14027
"14028",141,"long letter, full of my own concerns alone, will be enough to tire even",14028
"14029",141,"the friendship of a Fanny. The last time I saw Crawford was at Mrs.",14029

"14031",141,"hear of him. There is not a shadow of wavering. He thoroughly knows his",14031
"14032",141,"own mind, and acts up to his resolutions: an inestimable quality. I",14032
"14033",141,"could not see him and my eldest sister in the same room without",14033
"14034",141,"recollecting what you once told me, and I acknowledge that they did not",14034
"14035",141,"meet as friends. There was marked coolness on her side. They scarcely",14035
"14036",141,"spoke. I saw him draw back surprised, and I was sorry that Mrs.",14036
"14037",141,"Rushworth should resent any former supposed slight to Miss Bertram. You",14037
"14038",141,"will wish to hear my opinion of Maria’s degree of comfort as a wife.",14038
"14039",141,"There is no appearance of unhappiness. I hope they get on pretty well",14039
"14040",141,"together. I dined twice in Wimpole Street, and might have been there",14040
"14041",141,"oftener, but it is mortifying to be with Rushworth as a brother. Julia",14041
"14042",141,"seems to enjoy London exceedingly. I had little enjoyment there, but",14042
"14043",141,"have less here. We are not a lively party. You are very much wanted. I",14043
"14044",141,"miss you more than I can express. My mother desires her best love, and",14044
"14045",141,"hopes to hear from you soon. She talks of you almost every hour, and I",14045
"14046",141,"am sorry to find how many weeks more she is likely to be without you.",14046
"14047",141,"My father means to fetch you himself, but it will not be till after",14047
"14048",141,"Easter, when he has business in town. You are happy at Portsmouth, I",14048
"14049",141,"hope, but this must not be a yearly visit. I want you at home, that I",14049
"14050",141,"may have your opinion about Thornton Lacey. I have little heart for",14050
"14051",141,"extensive improvements till I know that it will ever have a mistress. I",14051
"14052",141,"think I shall certainly write. It is quite settled that the Grants go",14052
"14053",141,"to Bath; they leave Mansfield on Monday. I am glad of it. I am not",14053
"14054",141,"comfortable enough to be fit for anybody; but your aunt seems to feel",14054
"14055",141,"out of luck that such an article of Mansfield news should fall to my",14055

"14058",141,"“I never will, no, I certainly never will wish for a letter again,” was",14058

"14064",141,"she was within half a minute of starting the idea that Sir Thomas was",14064
"14065",141,"quite unkind, both to her aunt and to herself. As for the main subject",14065
"14066",141,"of the letter, there was nothing in that to soothe irritation. She was",14066
"14067",141,"almost vexed into displeasure and anger against Edmund. “There is no",14067
"14068",141,"good in this delay,” said she. “Why is not it settled? He is blinded,",14068

"14070",141,"before him so long in vain. He will marry her, and be poor and",14070
"14071",141,"miserable. God grant that her influence do not make him cease to be",14071
"14072",141,"respectable!” She looked over the letter again. “‘So very fond of me!’",14072

"14074",141,"friends leading her astray for years! She is quite as likely to have",14074
"14075",141,"led _them_ astray. They have all, perhaps, been corrupting one another;",14075
"14076",141,"but if they are so much fonder of her than she is of them, she is the",14076
"14077",141,"less likely to have been hurt, except by their flattery. ‘The only",14077
"14078",141,"woman in the world whom he could ever think of as a wife.’ I firmly",14078
"14079",141,"believe it. It is an attachment to govern his whole life. Accepted or",14079
"14080",141,"refused, his heart is wedded to her for ever. ‘The loss of Mary I must",14080
"14081",141,"consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and Fanny.’ Edmund, you",14081
"14082",141,"do not know me. The families would never be connected if you did not",14082

"14224",141,"for a little medical imposition. The fever was subdued; the fever had",14224
"14225",141,"been his complaint; of course he would soon be well again. Lady Bertram",14225
"14226",141,"could think nothing less, and Fanny shared her aunt’s security, till",14226
"14227",141,"she received a few lines from Edmund, written purposely to give her a",14227
"14228",141,"clearer idea of his brother’s situation, and acquaint her with the",14228
"14229",141,"apprehensions which he and his father had imbibed from the physician",14229
"14230",141,"with respect to some strong hectic symptoms, which seemed to seize the",14230
"14231",141,"frame on the departure of the fever. They judged it best that Lady",14231
"14232",141,"Bertram should not be harassed by alarms which, it was to be hoped,",14232
"14233",141,"would prove unfounded; but there was no reason why Fanny should not",14233

"14235",141,"",14235
"14236",141,"A very few lines from Edmund shewed her the patient and the sickroom in",14236
"14237",141,"a juster and stronger light than all Lady Bertram’s sheets of paper",14237
"14238",141,"could do. There was hardly any one in the house who might not have",14238
"14239",141,"described, from personal observation, better than herself; not one who",14239
"14240",141,"was not more useful at times to her son. She could do nothing but glide",14240
"14241",141,"in quietly and look at him; but when able to talk or be talked to, or",14241
"14242",141,"read to, Edmund was the companion he preferred. His aunt worried him by",14242
"14243",141,"her cares, and Sir Thomas knew not how to bring down his conversation",14243
"14244",141,"or his voice to the level of irritation and feebleness. Edmund was all",14244
"14245",141,"in all. Fanny would certainly believe him so at least, and must find",14245
"14246",141,"that her estimation of him was higher than ever when he appeared as the",14246
"14247",141,"attendant, supporter, cheerer of a suffering brother. There was not",14247

"14382",141,"hear there has been any mistake, but the report is so prevalent that I",14382
"14383",141,"confess I cannot help trembling. To have such a fine young man cut off",14383

"14386",141,"I see you smile and look cunning, but, upon my honour, I never bribed a",14386

"14787",141,"stationed at a window, in eager observation of the departure of a large",14787

"14800",141,"usual dinner-time, and as they approached the beloved place, the hearts",14800
"14801",141,"of both sisters sank a little. Fanny began to dread the meeting with",14801

"14805",141,"into action. Visions of good and ill breeding, of old vulgarisms and",14805
"14806",141,"new gentilities, were before her; and she was meditating much upon",14806
"14807",141,"silver forks, napkins, and finger-glasses. Fanny had been everywhere",14807
"14808",141,"awake to the difference of the country since February; but when they",14808
"14809",141,"entered the Park her perceptions and her pleasures were of the keenest",14809
"14810",141,"sort. It was three months, full three months, since her quitting it,",14810
"14811",141,"and the change was from winter to summer. Her eye fell everywhere on",14811
"14812",141,"lawns and plantations of the freshest green; and the trees, though not",14812
"14813",141,"fully clothed, were in that delightful state when farther beauty is",14813

"14846",141,"all the house under her care, had been an advantage entirely thrown",14846
"14847",141,"away; she had been unable to direct or dictate, or even fancy herself",14847
"14848",141,"useful. When really touched by affliction, her active powers had been",14848
"14849",141,"all benumbed; and neither Lady Bertram nor Tom had received from her",14849
"14850",141,"the smallest support or attempt at support. She had done no more for",14850

"15028",141,"others when, if a friend is at hand, the heart must be opened, and",15028
"15029",141,"everything told; no one else in the room, except his mother, who, after",15029

"15034",141,"certainly never tax her kindness in the same way again; she need not",15034
"15035",141,"fear a repetition; it would be a subject prohibited entirely: he",15035

"15041",141,"delight, how the agitation of his voice was watched, and how carefully",15041
"15042",141,"her own eyes were fixed on any object but himself, may be imagined. The",15042
"15043",141,"opening was alarming. He had seen Miss Crawford. He had been invited to",15043
"15044",141,"see her. He had received a note from Lady Stornaway to beg him to call;",15044
"15045",141,"and regarding it as what was meant to be the last, last interview of",15045
"15046",141,"friendship, and investing her with all the feelings of shame and",15046
"15047",141,"wretchedness which Crawford’s sister ought to have known, he had gone",15047
"15048",141,"to her in such a state of mind, so softened, so devoted, as made it for",15048
"15049",141,"a few moments impossible to Fanny’s fears that it should be the last.",15049
"15050",141,"But as he proceeded in his story, these fears were over. She had met",15050
"15051",141,"him, he said, with a serious—certainly a serious—even an agitated air;",15051
"15052",141,"but before he had been able to speak one intelligible sentence, she had",15052
"15053",141,"introduced the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him. “‘I",15053
"15054",141,"heard you were in town,’ said she; ‘I wanted to see you. Let us talk",15054
"15055",141,"over this sad business. What can equal the folly of our two relations?’",15055
"15056",141,"I could not answer, but I believe my looks spoke. She felt reproved.",15056
"15057",141,"Sometimes how quick to feel! With a graver look and voice she then",15057
"15058",141,"added, ‘I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister’s expense.’ So she",15058
"15059",141,"began, but how she went on, Fanny, is not fit, is hardly fit to be",15059
"15060",141,"repeated to you. I cannot recall all her words. I would not dwell upon",15060
"15061",141,"them if I could. Their substance was great anger at the _folly_ of",15061
"15062",141,"each. She reprobated her brother’s folly in being drawn on by a woman",15062
"15063",141,"whom he had never cared for, to do what must lose him the woman he",15063
"15064",141,"adored; but still more the folly of poor Maria, in sacrificing such a",15064

"15075",141,"saw it only as folly, and that folly stamped only by exposure. The want",15075
"15076",141,"of common discretion, of caution: his going down to Richmond for the",15076
"15077",141,"whole time of her being at Twickenham; her putting herself in the power",15077
"15078",141,"of a servant; it was the detection, in short—oh, Fanny! it was the",15078
"15079",141,"detection, not the offence, which she reprobated. It was the imprudence",15079
"15080",141,"which had brought things to extremity, and obliged her brother to give",15080

"15101",141,"knew no guile should not suffer. She spoke of you with high praise and",15101
"15102",141,"warm affection; yet, even here, there was alloy, a dash of evil; for in",15102
"15103",141,"the midst of it she could exclaim, ‘Why would not she have him? It is",15103

"15120",141,"been used to hear others speak, as she imagined everybody else would",15120
"15121",141,"speak. Hers are not faults of temper. She would not voluntarily give",15121
"15122",141,"unnecessary pain to any one, and though I may deceive myself, I cannot",15122

"15138",141,"more than once as he continued. “‘We must persuade Henry to marry her,’",15138
"15139",141,"said she; ‘and what with honour, and the certainty of having shut",15139
"15140",141,"himself out for ever from Fanny, I do not despair of it. Fanny he must",15140
"15141",141,"give up. I do not think that even _he_ could now hope to succeed with",15141
"15142",141,"one of her stamp, and therefore I hope we may find no insuperable",15142
"15143",141,"difficulty. My influence, which is not small shall all go that way; and",15143
"15144",141,"when once married, and properly supported by her own family, people of",15144
"15145",141,"respectability as they are, she may recover her footing in society to a",15145
"15146",141,"certain degree. In some circles, we know, she would never be admitted,",15146
"15147",141,"but with good dinners, and large parties, there will always be those",15147
"15148",141,"who will be glad of her acquaintance; and there is, undoubtedly, more",15148
"15149",141,"liberality and candour on those points than formerly. What I advise is,",15149
"15150",141,"that your father be quiet. Do not let him injure his own cause by",15150
"15151",141,"interference. Persuade him to let things take their course. If by any",15151
"15152",141,"officious exertions of his, she is induced to leave Henry’s protection,",15152
"15153",141,"there will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain",15153
"15154",141,"with him. I know how he is likely to be influenced. Let Sir Thomas",15154
"15155",141,"trust to his honour and compassion, and it may all end well; but if he",15155

"15158",141,"After repeating this, Edmund was so much affected that Fanny, watching",15158
"15159",141,"him with silent, but most tender concern, was almost sorry that the",15159
"15160",141,"subject had been entered on at all. It was long before he could speak",15160
"15161",141,"again. At last, “Now, Fanny,” said he, “I shall soon have done. I have",15161
"15162",141,"told you the substance of all that she said. As soon as I could speak,",15162
"15163",141,"I replied that I had not supposed it possible, coming in such a state",15163
"15164",141,"of mind into that house as I had done, that anything could occur to",15164
"15165",141,"make me suffer more, but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in",15165
"15166",141,"almost every sentence. That though I had, in the course of our",15166
"15167",141,"acquaintance, been often sensible of some difference in our opinions,",15167
"15168",141,"on points, too, of some moment, it had not entered my imagination to",15168
"15169",141,"conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it. That",15169
"15170",141,"the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her",15170
"15171",141,"brother and my sister (with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended",15171
"15172",141,"not to say), but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself,",15172
"15173",141,"giving it every reproach but the right; considering its ill",15173
"15174",141,"consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance",15174
"15175",141,"of decency and impudence in wrong; and last of all, and above all,",15175
"15176",141,"recommending to us a compliance, a compromise, an acquiescence in the",15176
"15177",141,"continuance of the sin, on the chance of a marriage which, thinking as",15177
"15178",141,"I now thought of her brother, should rather be prevented than sought;",15178
"15179",141,"all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never",15179
"15180",141,"understood her before, and that, as far as related to mind, it had been",15180
"15181",141,"the creature of my own imagination, not Miss Crawford, that I had been",15181
"15182",141,"too apt to dwell on for many months past. That, perhaps, it was best",15182
"15183",141,"for me; I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship, feelings,",15183
"15184",141,"hopes which must, at any rate, have been torn from me now. And yet,",15184
"15185",141,"that I must and would confess that, could I have restored her to what",15185
"15186",141,"she had appeared to me before, I would infinitely prefer any increase",15186
"15187",141,"of the pain of parting, for the sake of carrying with me the right of",15187
"15188",141,"tenderness and esteem. This is what I said, the purport of it; but, as",15188
"15189",141,"you may imagine, not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have",15189
"15190",141,"repeated it to you. She was astonished, exceedingly astonished—more",15190
"15191",141,"than astonished. I saw her change countenance. She turned extremely",15191
"15192",141,"red. I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings: a great, though short",15192
"15193",141,"struggle; half a wish of yielding to truths, half a sense of shame, but",15193
"15194",141,"habit, habit carried it. She would have laughed if she could. It was a",15194
"15195",141,"sort of laugh, as she answered, ‘A pretty good lecture, upon my word.",15195
"15196",141,"Was it part of your last sermon? At this rate you will soon reform",15196
"15197",141,"everybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey; and when I hear of you next,",15197
"15198",141,"it may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of Methodists,",15198
"15199",141,"or as a missionary into foreign parts.’ She tried to speak carelessly,",15199
"15200",141,"but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear. I only said in",15200
"15201",141,"reply, that from my heart I wished her well, and earnestly hoped that",15201
"15202",141,"she might soon learn to think more justly, and not owe the most",15202
"15203",141,"valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire, the knowledge of",15203
"15204",141,"ourselves and of our duty, to the lessons of affliction, and",15204
"15205",141,"immediately left the room. I had gone a few steps, Fanny, when I heard",15205
"15206",141,"the door open behind me. ‘Mr. Bertram,’ said she. I looked back. ‘Mr.",15206
"15207",141,"Bertram,’ said she, with a smile; but it was a smile ill-suited to the",15207
"15208",141,"conversation that had passed, a saucy playful smile, seeming to invite",15208
"15209",141,"in order to subdue me; at least it appeared so to me. I resisted; it",15209
"15210",141,"was the impulse of the moment to resist, and still walked on. I have",15210
"15211",141,"since, sometimes, for a moment, regretted that I did not go back, but I",15211
"15212",141,"know I was right, and such has been the end of our acquaintance. And",15212
"15213",141,"what an acquaintance has it been! How have I been deceived! Equally in",15213
"15214",141,"brother and sister deceived! I thank you for your patience, Fanny. This",15214
"15215",141,"has been the greatest relief, and now we will have done.”",15215
"15216",141,"",15216
"15217",141,"And such was Fanny’s dependence on his words, that for five minutes she",15217
"15218",141,"thought they _had_ done. Then, however, it all came on again, or",15218
"15219",141,"something very like it, and nothing less than Lady Bertram’s rousing",15219
"15220",141,"thoroughly up could really close such a conversation. Till that",15220
"15221",141,"happened, they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone, and how she",15221
"15222",141,"had attached him, and how delightful nature had made her, and how",15222
"15223",141,"excellent she would have been, had she fallen into good hands earlier.",15223
"15224",141,"Fanny, now at liberty to speak openly, felt more than justified in",15224
"15225",141,"adding to his knowledge of her real character, by some hint of what",15225
"15226",141,"share his brother’s state of health might be supposed to have in her",15226
"15227",141,"wish for a complete reconciliation. This was not an agreeable",15227
"15228",141,"intimation. Nature resisted it for a while. It would have been a vast",15228
"15229",141,"deal pleasanter to have had her more disinterested in her attachment;",15229
"15230",141,"but his vanity was not of a strength to fight long against reason. He",15230
"15231",141,"submitted to believe that Tom’s illness had influenced her, only",15231
"15232",141,"reserving for himself this consoling thought, that considering the many",15232
"15233",141,"counteractions of opposing habits, she had certainly been _more_",15233
"15234",141,"attached to him than could have been expected, and for his sake been",15234
"15235",141,"more near doing right. Fanny thought exactly the same; and they were",15235
"15236",141,"also quite agreed in their opinion of the lasting effect, the indelible",15236
"15237",141,"impression, which such a disappointment must make on his mind. Time",15237
"15238",141,"would undoubtedly abate somewhat of his sufferings, but still it was a",15238
